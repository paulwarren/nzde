>  The name `cabbage-tree' was given by Captain Cook's people. ... Journal, 10th October, 1774 : `These cabbage-trees or palms were not thicker than a man's leg, and from ten to twenty feet high. They are of the same genus with the cocoa-nut tree ; like it they have very large pinnated leaves, and are the same sort as the second sort found in the northern parts of New South Wales [vide Hawkesworth Voyages Vol 3]. The cabbage is, properly speaking, the bud of the tree ; each tree producing but one cabbage which is at the crown, where the leaves spring out, and is enclosed in the stem ... -->[Cook, Voyage to Pacific Ocean 1777 Vol II pp 148-9] ... The remarks that the leaves are pinnate, that each tree produces but one cabbage, and that the cutting of it destroys the tree, lead one to suspect that the tree referred to is not a Cordyline. The entry in the Journal was made at Norfolk Island, not New Zealand, but there is no indication in Cook as to what tree is referred to. ... A more definite clue in Banks (Journal of the Rt Hon Sir Joseph Banks during Captain Cook's First Voyage ... 1768-77, London, 1896 p227), where he writes of New zealand [sic] plants ... A footnote identifies the [`cabbage-tree'] as Areca Sapida Soland. ... [Nikau] ... `very closely related to the Norfolk Island A. Baueri which is a larger plant' [Hooker]. [Banks] says nothing of the eating of the young shoots of the Cordyline. It would appear, then, that primarily the term `cabbage-tree', `cabbage-palm' was applied to Areca Baueri, but has become transferred exclusively to Cordyline ...

Cheeseman, too, says, `Universally known to New Zealand residents by the inappropriate name of "cabbage-tree"' (Cheeseman, Manual NZ Flora p707). Thomas explains the name and errs in doing so : `It receives its name from the arrangement of its leaves in tufts or heads at the ends of the branches' (Clark A Southern Cross Fairy-tale p53). Butler remarks `The cabbage-tree or ti-palm is not a true palm, though it looks like one. It has not the least resemblance to a cabbage.' The settlers and bushmen followed Cook in using the young heart as a vegetable, and in their naming of the tree ; and when the reason for the name is known its inapproriateness disappears. To one section of the public it will always be the cabbage-tree ; to the other section, let it be lily-palm. `Ti-tree' and ti-palm' should certainly be banned, because of the hopeless confusion with tea-tree.

In a `Calcutta' subscripters are ... 1 pound each ... and are not governed by the number of horses in the race upon which the sweep is based. Slips of paper with the horses written on then placed in a hat and in another hat - names of subscribers. Promoter ... takes role of auctioneer ... each horse drawn offered at auction and sold to highest bidder ... full amount bid has only to be paid if the buyer is not the drawer of that particular horse. If the drawer should buy the horse in, then he pays only half the amount bid, and the money goes into the pool. If the buyer does not draw the horse, the amount bid is divided, half to the drawer and half to the pool. <i>(1939,Outside the Law,169</i>)

>  <b>NEWTON</b> [Reference 1928] Another memory of that meeting [at Springfield, c1928] is the `Calcutta Sweep'. This was a common practice in those days and now that it seems to be a thing of the past it might be worth describing. The evening before the event concerned the crowd would get together and every dog on the programme would be put up for `auction'. The proceeds of the `sale' would be pooled, divided into first, second and third money, and after the actual event was finished this went to the men who had `purchased' the placed dogs. <i>(1971,Ten Thousand Dogs,45</i>)

>  [The] system, known casually as the Calcutta sweep, is practised in most clubs round the country and makes amateur golfers wealthy men through golf as an amateur sport. Basically, the idea works on the system of paired golfers who compete for prize-money put up by their fellow club-members ... The pairs are deemed horses and are bought at local club auctions by other club members. And it is at those auctions that anything happens ... The competition is usually run on a match-play basis with the winning couple collecting half of what they have won while the `owner' who bought them gets the other half ... I know of one team that went for $3 all up and won a calcutta. <i>(Jun 23, 1974,Sunday Times (NZ),20</i>)

It consisted of two hard wood runners, about thirty feet in length, with two mortised and cross-bolsters about ten feet apart, on which the logs were placed, and well chocked. In order to prevent the runners from catching on the skids they were rounded off with an upwards snipe, and this was done at both ends, thus avoiding the necessity of the turning the cat around for the return trip. <i>(1953,Story of the Kauri, The,180</i>)

>  <b>NEWTON</b> No man, even if he were actually in the pen could bring another sheep out on the board after the bell had gone [for smoko etc]. For the last 10 minutes of each run, the men would endeavour to select sheep which would enable them to just beat the gong and get an extra sheep. This was known as `getting the catch.' With the old New Zealand hours of 5.30 to 5.30, the day was broken into 6 `runs', and getting a `catch' each time meant another half a dozen sheep to the day's tally. <i>(1949,High Country Days,53</i>)

 <i>n.</i> the hardest (usu. the last) sheep left in the shearing pen

>  <b>M EREDITH</b> When the word is given to start, the shearers go into the `catching-pen' and feel over the sheep, select one, carry it out on to the shearing-floor, and commence shearing. Naturally, the easiest-shorn sheep -- `bare-bellies' and `bare points' -- are selected first.

Opposite each of these are two shearers, who draw their sheep one by one out of their pen until the pen is exhausted. Naturally each man tries to pick a sheep that looks easy to shear, so the last one is generally a great ugly brute with matted wool and his fleece full of sand. This fellow is invariably nicknamed the `cobbler.' <i>(1904,Sport in NZ,172</i>)

>  The `cobbler' used to be the last sheep in a shearing pen probably because he `sticks to the last.' - being usually rough-fleeced or burry or dirty, or otherwise objectionable....

>  Montana would, in the 1960s, expand its operations to a 120-hectare vineyard at Mangatangi in the northern Waikato and would soon launch onto the market a concoction which even today lives on in the national memory of a generation - Cold Duck, along with Montana Pearl, was made from siebel bybrid grapes with a touch of sherry material thrown in. Drunk like cordial at student balls, these two - and another Montana line, an orange-flavoured concoction called Poulet Poulet - possibly led to more acts of sexual intercourse than any other contributing factor in the New Zealand of the late 1960s and early 1970s. <i>(Oct 1999,North & South,75</i>)

>  [Montana's] recent release of the most notorious proto-alcopop, Cold Duck, refreshed memories of an old marketing wheeze. <i>Ibid.</i> 51 The only thing more intriguing than Montana's recent exposure of its dirty duck linen was the media orgy that it provoked, with a raft of bizarre 70s nostalgia riding on the Cold Duck wave... Cold Duck was certainly the most popular of the booze labels that served those grim days when getting legless was the sole purpose of a night out. <i>(Jul 19, 1997,Listener (New Zealand Listener),15</i>)

>  Wolfe, co-author of <i>New Zealand! New Zealand, in Praise of Kiwiana</i> suggests [Lindauer] can be equated to Cold Duck, the sparkling red wine that celebrated its 25th anniversary in 1997 with a re-release from Montana, selling at $8.95 a bottle. <i>(Apr 29, 2001,Sunday Star Times,D6</i>)

The New Zealander usually thinks he means one year beyond high school, and therefore thinks of American educational standards as being lower than they are. <i>(1954,These New Zealanders,49</i>)

## copper Maori
 
 <i>n.</i> Copper Maori seems to have been used by Europeans in the North Island (esp. Northland) for the more usual hangi, umu. with <i>copper</i>. The Maori suffix (variously spelt in early texts) is curious. (1) It is used both with its flexionless Maori pl and its anglicised pl in -s. (2) If it is an aj, the placement after the noun follows Maori grammatical usage: a fuller anglicisation would be <i>Maori copper</i>, occas. used. (3) Williams (p?) states that <i>Maori aj and n `native, belonging to New Zealand' is a comparatively recent use not recorded before 1850, and probably first used by Maoris themselves. Is this an early Maori use of the modern sense of Maori? Or an early Pakeha use? (4) Or is it a use of the sense `normal, usual, ordinary' <i>- kopa Maori</i> being the usual earth-oven, perhaps distinct from the iron tripot etc., (then called in English `copper'), the <i>*kopa Pakeha; </i> (See [hangi](../H#hangi),[umu](../U#umu))

>  We cooked some meat in a copper mauri or hangi, being the native term which is an excellent method of cooking. <i>(1843,NZ Journal,4(95) : 216</i>)

>  <b>WALES</b> It having been discovered on board that most of [the bread] which we had in Butts was damp and Mouldy; to day a Copper Oven was brought on Shore and fixed up by the Tent to rebake it.' (5) Whatever is the case, the term seems to be influenced by English copper, which could transliterate as something like <i>*kopara, *kapara</i> in the early 19th century. cf. also Markham's trasliteration of <i>kapura</i> (1834 NZ 38): the Natives told him to his Teeth ... they would put (Corpora) Fire to it.<i> [Note irrelevantly that the English word boiler was transliterated into Maori as paera, its early or dial. variant pron. /bail*/.] 1.

"There was also a 'posser' which was a pole with a sort of vacuum creating hood on the end which was used to dump or dunk the clothes up and down and help shift the dirt." John Mihaljevic (jmjm@ihug.co.nz) writes that a BBC World Service My Century documentary (The Invention that Feed Women) broadcast by Radio NZ has a woman born in the East End of London in 1927 describing washdays (presumably the 1930s) and referring to her mother's use of copper sticks. "This was not just any piece of wood, but a specific tool; she described it as a 'one-handled rolling pin'" Alan Burnett (aged 75) writes (2/10/1999) that when he was a child in Scotland "we always spoke of the copper-stick or SPURKLE which was made by cutting a broom-handle in half! and used for poking the boiling clothes.]

>  .. markedly faulty fleeces showing break, cotting and weak, open backs. <i>(Nov 11, 1951,NZ Farmer,8</i>)

>  The chief effect of age appeared to be increasing the number of cotts rather than the severity of cotting. <i>(Sep 14, 1961,NZ Farmer,8</i>)

>  <b>HENDERSON</b> Usually when wool is affected by break it is also deficient in some other respects chiefly through associated cotting and yellow staining. <i>(1968,Growing Better Wool,37</i>)

>  It is a widely held view that frequent wetting leads to severe cotting. <i>(1968,Growing Better Wool,64</i>)

>  <b>BARTON</b> Thus it seems that the factors contributing to fibre length (staple length, soundness and freedom from cotting) could be of greater future importance. <i>(1971,Sheepfarming Annual 1971,5</i>)

Between 1881 and 1945 the `country quota' was added to the population of rural electorates which, for the purposes of the Electoral Act, meant population other than that contained in a city or borough of over 2,000 inhabitants, or in any area within 5 miles of the chief post offices in Auckland, Wellington, Christchurch, or Dunedin. <i>(1966,Encyclopaedia of New Zealand, An,I/861</i>)

## couta stick
 
 <i>n.</i> pa na2..

>  <b>GRAHAM</b> BARRACOUTA (MANGA) <i>Leionura atun dentatus</i> (Bloch and Schneider) INCREDIBLE as it may seem these fish, with their well-armed jaws of sharp fang-like teeth, were usually caught on a slightly curved stick about four feet in length. Fastened to this stick was a piece of stout fishing line about three to four feet in length, carrying a piece of red-coloured wood - usually cedar - about five to six inches in length. A bent nail was secured to this piece of wood in the form of a hook but no bait was used. When a school of Barracouta was found the Couta stick, or paw, was brought out ready for fishing. From the cockpit of the launch the piece of wood with the nail was violently swirled with a circular motion in and out of the water, causing a disturbance of the water in a good imitation of a number of Sprats, Pilchards or other small fish jumping in and out of the sea. The Barracouta would swim for such a place. Seeing the piece of red wood moving rapidly through the water they would take it for a fish, snap at it or even jump out of the water for the lure and were caught by the crude iron hook. As the fish was hooked during the time the paw was being drawn through the water the fisherman would swing the fish over his head above the boat or launch and when the caught fish was midway in the air, more or less above the cockpit, would expertly give the stick a dexterous smart twist. As there was no barb on the hook the fish was released and fell into the cockpit. <i>(1956,NZ Fishes: An Identification Guide,310</i>)

>  <b>GRAHAM</b> [<i>Ibid</i> 311] Should there be any Barracouta about the... Couta sticks were then set to work to paw the water and attract Barracouta to the spot. [<i>I bid.</i>314] The Maori also knew he could catch Barracouta without bait and he, too, used a short piece of stick and line with a baitless hook and leaned over his canoe and threshed the water to and fro, which is known as `Kaihau manga!' When the European fisherman called his fishing outfit [315] `paw', the Maori uses the term `pa'. This fish was a great favourite with them and was caught in large numbers. On returning to the shore, the women cleaned the fish and then hung them up on racks to dry in the sun. Old Maoris of Opotiki told me they used a chip of Tawhai (<i>Nothofagus fusca</i>), which is dark red, in the making of a pa (paw). <i>(1956,NZ Fishes: An Identification Guide,311</i>)



## Coutts clause

It now reads "from March 2 this year a person contracted, employed, paid or otherwise engaged by a competitor, may not be engaged by another competitor."

>  <b>MILLER</b> Like a child's cradle, [a miner's cradle] had two rockers fastened to its base, and it was rocked rather more violently. But internally the resemblance ended. It was, broadly speaking, an open box with the sides sloping inwards towards the base, and the bottom board extended about a foot beyond the end; while the end board, which formed one of the sides, did not reach to the bottom, but left an aperture. The box was fitted on top with an iron hopper punched full of quarter-inch holes and with sides about three inches high. It was into this hopper that the gold-bearing gravel was thrown, a shovelful at a time. <i>(1946,There Was Gold,41</i>)

>  <b>MILLER</b> It took two men to work the cradle satisfactorily - one to shovel and one to rock it violently by means of a handle that was fastened up the back end of the contraption, and at the same time to dash water on to it by means of a dipper fastened to a stick. The cradle was always placed, of course, at the water's edge, and the stones that did not fall through the hopper were tipped out the front end, which was left without any retaining side. The material which was washed through the holes, and which contained the gold, fell straight down on to a sloping wooden table covered with a coarse piece of matting on which the gold was saved. The table was fitted firmly against the back and sides of the box, but stopped short about an inch from the front end to allow the tailings and what gold was not saved to fall on to another table - this one fitting firmly to the front end and the sides, and sloping dowm towards the back end. From there the tailings fell on to the back end of the bottom board, which was generally covered with coconut matting to catch any gold that might have gone all the distance, and followed along the bottom and out over the lip. By this means the wash had to travel a surprisingly long distance, and was also shaken from side to side of the cradle, so that there little chance if it was worked properly of losing any gold. <i>(1946,There Was Gold,41 (cont.)</i>)

>  Crown entities are not departments or ministries, like the Department of Internal Affairs or the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade. Neither are they state-owned enterprises, like New Zealand Post. The term crown entity has been applied like a mop to most of the other bodies which the crown has set up over the years to carry out little bits of its business. There are about 160 of them... We've divided them into five categories... Crown agents... Independent, quasi-judicial bodies (e.g. the Police Complaints Authority or the Environmental Risk Management Authority)..Trusts (e.g. Road Safety Trust).. Companies (e.g. Radio New Zealand).. Other organisations (e.g. schools). <i>(Jul 28, 1999,Dominion,12</i>)

>  We have a general environment, an ambience, an atmosphere, in which Maori people feel they are justified in making all sorts of ridiculous claims simply because they have customary rights guaranteed under the Treaty of Waitangi. <i>(Jan 25, 1998,Sunday Star Times,Focus 4</i>)

>  The most pervasive customary right was customary title, which, though unique, almost equated to ownership. It was territorial and the hapu could not have existed without the full use of the land in question. To prove a customary title, a hapu had to show it was in exclusive occupation of the land prior to sovereignty passing and that it had continued to follow customary activities on it ever since. <i>(May 21, 2003,Dominion Post,B7</i>)

>  What is customary title? Much like an ordinary title to land, customary title confers rights to the holder. These could include the right to use the land for farming or living on.

>  Ministers know that Maori aspirations extend beyond isolated shellfish beds and reefs, and they doubt that the Maori Land Court has the power to award "customary use" rather than "customary" title. <i>(Jun 30, 2003,Dominion Post,B5</i>)

>  Waitangi Fisheries Commissioner Maui Solomon insisted that you could not legally distinguish customary use from legal title so easily. <i>(Jul 5, 2003,Listener (New Zealand Listener),14</i>)

>  The distinction is important because, one imagines, it doesn't take a tribunal or court to declare that Maori can continue to visit and use their local beaches s they have always done, as in "customary use". They can do that now. <i>(Jul 12, 2003,Listener (New Zealand Listener),15</i>)
