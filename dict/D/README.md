The removal of dags from the hind-quarters of sheep is a seasonal operation usually called `crutching.' Used personally, `dag' was earlier a term of some approbation.

## deer track
 
 <i>n.</i> [(deer shooters')]

>  In recent years there seems to have been a tendency to use both track and trail and to differentiate between them. A trail seems to be something narrow and perhaps rather hardto follow - a way marked only by blazes or worn by animals, usually deer. A track seems to be something broader, cut or formed by man. ... A well-known older Club member made this distinction when, on hearing him speak of a deer trail, I asked him what he thought to be the difference between track and trail. I remarked that I thought it a very recent distinction, one not occurring in the Club until about 1957. He disagreed, believing it to be one he had always known. Yet, on looking through The Tramper, I could not find deer trail used until 1944, but deer track occurs from the first number in 1928 onwards, and he himself had used it in 1940. It remains to be seen whether this distinction will become established. In the meantime deer track still seems to be used far more than deer trail. <i>(Sep 1958,Tararua,25</i>) [NOTES: Ruth Mason `Track and Trail']

In Sydney, `The Block' is that portion of the city bounded by King, George, Hunter, and Pitt Streets. It is now really two blocks, but was all in one till the Government purchased the land for the present Post Office, and then opened a new street from George to Pitt Street. Since then the Government, having purchased more land, has made the street much wider, and it is now called Martin's Place. <i>Ibid.</i> 37 <i>Block, on the (1) On the promenade above referred to. </i> <i>(1898,Austral English,36</i>)

>  <b>SUTTON-SMITH</b> Once or twice we [sc a boys' impromptu band] `did the block,' but I am afraid our collection was even more inadequate to our supposed needs than the Army's was to theirs. A Guy Fawkes appeal was much better supported. The Army was considered either irreverent or a pest.

>  The Wanganui Chronicle says: The latest idea in "sweeps" is what is known as the "Pacific Slope" stakes. All the names of the prominent business men are entered, and the drawer of the next person who leaves his Wanganui creditors and crosses the Pacific, scoops the pool. We hear that the stakes are large, so it may be worth the while of the holder of them to do the "slope" himself. <i>(Nov 19, 1889,North Otago Times,4</i>)

## Dog Town
 
 <i>n.</i> (derogatory) an early nickname for Port Chalmers (cf. the occasional PIGTOWN for Picton) [(coastal seamen's) ca1920 Pugh-Williams p.c.May 1951 Port Chalmers, perhaps because it comprises the proverbial `only one man and a dog' only.]

>  <b>BOWMAN</b> During the [1890] strike about 100 seamen unattached in Port Chalmers stayed in hotels and boarding houses, but a large number of them found residence in the "baches" in what was called "Sweat Rag Alley", consisting of a number of small baches or cribs in a double row where the Corporation Yard now is. Each bach housed three or four men and it was said that each man had a dog. From this fact, the area became known as "Dogtown". <i>(1948,Port Chalmers,53</i>)

>  To the uninitiated this may mean nothing, but, to those in the know, the quickest way to cause a riot and to raise an insurrection is to call an inhabitant of Port Chalmers a dweller in Dogtown. <i>(Jul 8, 1911,NZ Truth,315/7/1</i>)

>  <b>CRYER</b> There are two explanations for the term Dog Town. The first has its clue in the name of the town, Port Chalmers, which obviously had a lot of docks.

But there are also legends that.. there were always many seamen about, sometimes unemployed, and all of them were accompanied by their dogs. Most of these men lived in cottages in George Street which became known locally as Dog Town and the name spread to mean Port Chalmers in general. It's occasionally heard even today. <i>(2001,Curious Questions,63</i>)

>  <b>STEWART</b> And during the troubles [sc. an 1890 strike] , about 100 seamen from other ports stayed in baches in an area called 'Sweat Rag Alley' in Port Chalmers.

>  The crown was called a bull, a cartwheel, a caser, five bob, and most familiar of all a dollar, the latter dating from the time when the rate of exchange was four US dollars to the pound.

The half crown was called a half-dollar, a half-bull, half-caser, two-and-a-kick, and two-and-a-buck. In the latter instance buck stands for sixpence, though apparently this term was rarely used by itself for that coin denomination, but almost always in association with a number of shillings. The florin seems to have had fewer English nicknames, only two bob being recorded as being in use in New Zealand. <i>(Oct 1977,NZ Numismatic Journal,15</i>)

It first came into general use during the World War of 1914-18, when the New Zealanders who fought in the ill-starred Gallipoli campaign were referred to as `the men from Down Under', but that was not the start of it. This faraway land, it seems, was known as `Down Under' in some parts of England and Scotland before the birth of the present century. The first World War merely [put] the expression into wider usage. An Auckland artist, Mr Trevor Lloyd,made it the subject of one of his cartoons at the very beginning of that great upheaval, and at least one English war correspondent used the term when writing on Gallipoli. After the year 1918 the expression fell into disuse, but during the second World War it again became popular, and I think we must thank the Americans for its revival. ... In England it is also known as the Antipodes. <i>(1945,If You'd Care to Know,7</i>)

When a tree fell before it was quite severed, it sometimes, in the act of falling, wrenched or `drew' out a portion of the butt, leaving great jagged, fang-like splinters adhering to the stump. The damage was, of course, always to the heart wood ... [<i>Ibid.</i> 156 [Edward Thompson] ... very often, before the saw got within a foot or so of the front scarf, the tree would start to fall gradually, and the uncut timber between the saw and the front scarf would have to break, and seldom cleanly; the heart, being more brittle than the sap, would break here and there, several feet above where thesawcut would have been standing straight. As the tree fell, these pieces, still attached to the stump, would draw out of the tree, and being almost heart-wood constituted the chief defect we call `draws'. <i>(1953,Story of the Kauri, The,151</i>) [NOTES: [?c1900]]

To save time ... you do not waste time by chopping down each tree individually, but just `scarf' and partly chop each tree.

>  <b>WILSON</b> A `drive' was in progress; as the men do the underscrubbing they note the large trees and their distance from each other. They scarf each one so that it will fall on the next. Then, after all the smaller timber has been brought down, they fell the first tree which falls on the second and so starts a whole sequence of crashes. The line need not be straight. More often, it zig-zags from right to left. Bushmen can do wonders by means of an ingenious drive. <i>(1955,Land of My Children,11</i>)

He came to New Zealand in 1929 to be a lecturer at the newly-founded Massey Agricultural College. Shortly after his arrival Dr Dry discovered a ram lamb in a flock near Palmerston North which had an extremely hairy fleece due to an abundance of halo-hairs. Dr Dry's successful efforts to isolate the gene in Romney led to the development of the Drysdale. Dr Dry devoted nearly 40 years studying the genetic makeup of the fleece of the sheep and published many papers.
