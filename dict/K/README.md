This is the graceful little `Kahawai-bird' or `Sea-swallow,' which pursues schools of small surface fish, wheeling, darting and dipping to the water, in its energetic quest of food. Since the Kahawai fish is predaceous on the small school fish also, the tern is an excellent indicator of the presence of Kahawai. <i>(1947,Native Animals of NZ,80</i>)

>  <b>RiCHARDS</b> <i>Sterna ... frontalis [? striata] </i>... it pursues schools of small fish close to the coasts of New Zealand, Tasmania and Australia, and as the kahawai fish also feed on the same class of food, the tern is a useful indicator to fishermen of their presence.

Most prized was the <i>kahurangi</i> stone, bright green, translucent, hard and clear; the<i> inanga</i> variety perhaps comes next, with its white milky-veined appearance, [389] followed by the <i>kawakawa</i>, dark olive-green, dull and opaque. ... <i>Tangiwai</i> (`tear drop'), <i>bowenite</i>, a softer stone of a clear pale green, with the appearance of drops of water in the texture, was less esteemed, though more beautiful in the European eyes, whilst <i>kahotea</i>, green, spotted or streaked with black, was an inferior type, and was used for small chisels, and for objects of subordinate interest. <i>(1929,Primitive Economics of NZ Maori,388</i>)

## karaka
 
 <i>n.</i> <i>karaka</i> is the chief modern name among New Zealanders; others are obsolesc.

Early spgs (<i>cracker, kraka</i>) point to these pronunciations; even as accurate an observer as E. J. Wakefield would spell it `kraka' (perhaps [krak a]), although in his `Adventures in NZ' it is always written <i>karaka.</i> cf <i>cracker, caraceer;</i> a spreading tree common in coastal areas and producing orange fruit, the kernels of which are poisonous unless soaked and cooked [Maori]; cowtree, New Zealand laurel (kopi, Chatham island).

This seems to be difficult to acquire in these days. The lump must be scraped and cleaned and dried. ... `With an old metal frypan or an old metal plate on the hot range, moved about to get just the right temperature, the lump of gum was pressed on to the plate until the surface melted, and was then slowly drawn out to arm's length or further, and as this was done, the melted surface miraculously came away in these beautiful drawn fibres, which were placed on the nearby table. The operation was completed [sic: ? repeated] until the required three bundles of strands were produced. These were plaited with a standard three-plait. The conditions of the old-time warm and humid kitchen were very necessary for the success of this process, as the gum fibres when cold are very fragile. <i>(1972,Gumdiggers, The,25</i>) [NOTES: 1972 K.R.Mosheim in Reed Gumdiggers 25-26]

>  <b>McARA</b> Chamber sets had to be well anchored in the country and heavy bearers inserted beneath them to carry the `keps' or chairs on which the cages were placed when winding trucks of ore from the level. The legs supporting the first set above the level would be about ten feet high. <i>ibid. </i>316 <i>`Clips", "keps", or landing chairs</i>: A solid, dead flush, landing platform for the cages was required at each level and at the surface for getting full trucks in and out of cages. This platform was provided by a steel frame mounted on heavy bearers two or three feet below the level of the chamber floor so that it could be tilted into the shaft by a lever and make a strong support beneath the cages. it was balanced by a counterweight to make it easy to operate. <i>(1978,Gold Mining at Waihi,183</i>)

>  <b>McARA</b> To ensure that the two cages in the shaft worked exactly opposite each other when the chamberman `changed gear' to wind ore from a different level, he rang the change signal of five bells on the steel-wire knocker-line suspended in the shaft compartment, and the engine-driver placed the `free' cage on the surface `clips' (or `keps") and disengaged it on the engine drive-shaft. The chamberman then signalled to lift the `fast' cage on the level where he was working just clear of the clips, and pinned these back clear of the shaft. He entered the `fast' cage and rang the number of the level to which he wished to change, and was taken there by the driver. On arrival at the level he placed the clips in position in the shaft and rang the change signal, whereupon the driver placed the `fast' cage on the clips and put the `free' cage (which was sitting on the surface clips) in gear on the engine drive-shaft. Thus, when the cage was raised from the level to the surface, the cage from the surface would be exactly at the level from which the winding was taking place. Great care had always to be taken to ensure that the clips were not left protruding into the shaft as a serious accident could result if the cage crashed into them. <i>(1878,Gold Mining at Waihi,316(cont.)</i>)

 <i>n.</i>

>  <b>NEWTON</b> in Tom's early years at Puketiti, anything up to forty axemen were employed. They usually worked in gangs of four, and a gang would sometimes scarf for a full week before they let the `King' tree go. The procedure was to work `drives'. Depending on various factors, a certain defined area would be `scarfed', i.e. each tree in that area would have a scarf cut in it to the point where it was about to fall, and when the whole of that particular area was completed the `King' tree would be felled. This tree, specially selected for the purpose, would be so situated that, as it fell, it would take two or three of the scarfed trees with it. They in turn would do the same, and so on, and the whole area would fall almost as one. This is known as working a drive, and saves a tremendous amount of axe work. <i>(1972,Wake of The Axe,155</i>)

The name Hake applied to this fish is entirely wrong, as it belongs to the Snake Mackerel family, the <i>Gempylidae</i>.

After 1940 the kiwi became synonymous with New Zealand servicemen overseas. The Kiwi Concert Party, which toured many battle areas during the Second World War, and the Kiwi (New Zealand Army) Football Team, which toured the British isles, France, and Germany in 1945-46, greatly enhanced the emblem's popularity. ...

And for the name, you can be forgiven if you call our imported possum (the `brushtail possum,' to be precise) an opossum.

As recently as 1981, scientists who turned up for the first New Zealand symposium on marsupials ... were sagely talking about possums in 12 of the papers presented while their colleagues talked about opossums in six papers. All were referring to the same nocturnal nuisance. One of the great achievements of that symposium was to finish up talking the same language after taking a vote that favoured for possum. ...

>  There are passages that will offend indigenous sensibilities.

The <i>tatata</i> [as-acute] is similar in size to the former, having pending from every part, an infinity of small cords six inches long, of no use or ornament; its origin must be ascribed to the arbitrary taste of fashion, <i>(1840,Manners & Customs of the NZers,1/177</i>)

When Europeans commenced to settle in the Sounds the bush had practically established itself to the water's edge. The few vestiges of aboriginal cultivation were rapidly becoming clothed with a dense second growth and, except for a few localities occupied by the remnants of native tribes, had been practically obliterated. As the colonists commenced to clear the bush, despite the fact that on their land were large forest trees that had apparently taken centuries to grow, vestiges of an ancient occupation were brought to light in the shapes square or oblong pits. These pits were of varying shapes and sizes, many bunched into steep spurs and forming a series that reached from the shores to the tops of the low hills, and all placed in secure positions on land not liable to slip. These numerous pits were widely scattered throughout the Sounds and, some being similar to those in use in the North as store pits, they were called by the settlers' `Kumera pits' under the impression that they had been used to store those tubers for food supply. investigation proved this idea to be erroneous; the pits were found in positions unsuitable for such storage and the presence of shell heaps amongst them proved that they had formed part of the dwellings of an ancient people. <i>(1940,Marlborough</i>)
