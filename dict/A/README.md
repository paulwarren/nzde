Sport can sometimes be the theatre of the absurd and that would increase if the shortening craze caught on. The national cricket team would become known as the BCs, the netballers as the SFs, the soccer players as the AWs, the basketballers as the TBs. <i>(Jul 9, 2002,Dominion Post,D8</i>) [NOTES: Ron Palenski]

Other place names, such as Lake Waihola in South Otago and the nearby settlement of Wangaloa, also show this dialectical variation. Still others have been helpfully changed to sound more "Maori", such as Rangiora and Kaikoura, which were recorded by one Captain Edwardson in 1823 as Rockiola and Kowkoula, because that was the way the southern tribes pronounced them. <i>(Mar 20, 2004,Listener (New Zealand Listener),48</i>)

The real objection was that the Native transferrors [sic] purported to alienate the land before their own title by succession was complete. <i>(Oct 14, 1919,Poverty Bay Herald,5</i>)

>  The victories of the mining companies at the Thames are at least as encouraging as those of the colonial forces in the Taupo district. Although the natives still refuse to alienate the lands on the Upper Thames for mining uses, yet from the fact that parties of them have received from the Provincial Government recently large sums for gold licenses on the lower river, it may be supposed that their patriotism or obstinacy will yield in time to the temptation of increasing their easily-acquired gains. <i>(Mar 28, 1870,Daily Southern Cross,4</i>)

## alienated
 
 <i>adj.</i>

>  Not injudiciously, we think, the General Government refused assent to an Ordinance passed through the Provincial Council last Session, empowering the leasing for a term of years of a portion of the Bay Lands adjoining the town. ..The principle which guided the refusal was, as we understood it, the determination not to allow so much valuable land to become alienated, without any power being reserved to provide for municipal necessities. <i>(Apr 12, 1862,Otago Witness,7</i>)

>  "Where is the money to come from?" queried Mr. Reeves. I reply that no money at all is needed; and, further, that the re-purchase of alienated land is not only inefficient, but wrong in principle. <i>(Nov 9, 1895,Evening Post,2</i>)

>  The tenants have got the land for 999 years, and while we recognise the absurdity of that lease it cannot be broken without the consent of both parties. We may say, therefore, that the land is permanently alienated at present. <i>(Oct 5, 1906,Evening Post,7</i>)

>  But as the Premier plainly told the House last week, a great deal of pressure is being brought to bear on Ministers to induce them to legislate in the direction of freetrade in native lands. For our part, we have always opposed further alienation in fee in favour of leasing by the Crown as trustees for the owners. <i>(Oct 28, 1901,Evening Post,4</i>)

>  By clause 74 it is enacted that "in respect of all sales or other alienations of any waste lands of the Crown in New Zealand, in fee simple or any less estate or interest (except as therein particularly mentioned), there shall be paid to the New Zealand Company, in discharge of the principal sum and interest due to them, one fourth part of the sum paid by the purchaser in respect of every such sale or alienation." <i>(Nov 1, 1854,Nelson Examiner and New Zealand Chronicle,2</i>)

>  The other way to effect an alienation is to get the consent of the assembled owners. Any meeting of not less than five of the owners of native freehold land called together by the Maori Land Board, may agree to the alienation of the block by a majority vote, which would bind the whole number of owners. <i>(Jan 7, 1910,Bay of Plenty Times,4</i>)

>  The plan now adopted by the Government for securing to the native inhabitants of these islands a share in the advantages derived from the alienation of their lands to a more civilized race, seems to us calculated, if faithfully carried into effect, to preserve the native race and to raise them to the rank of civilized men. <i>(Mar 12, 1842,Nelson Examiner and New Zealand Chronicle,2</i>)

>  <b>BUDDLE</b> The objection ... arose from the foolish idea that is entertained by the Maories that opening roads will certainly lead to the alienation of their lands; as their main object clearly was the formation of a land league to prevent all further sales, ... ibid 20.

There may be rival claims to the coining of the famous appellation `All Blacks' ... but Mr Wiren's cuttings first display the words in the report of the Blackheath match in the `Football Evening News' of November 4, 1905. ... Subsequently [to the citation above] Blackheath are referred to as the `Black and Reds' and the New Zealanders as All Blacks without the embellishment ofquotation marks. ... Subsequently the `Daily Mail' for one, adopted the term `All Blacks' in preference to the `Colonial' or `New Zealand' footballers. It was some time before newspapers in this country followed suit. <i>(Oct 31, 1905,NZ Truth</i>) [NOTES: from Football Evening News [Britain] 1905 Nov 18[Note - month and days may be reversed between the two papers]]

>  <b>McLINTOCK</b> A Printer's Error? The name All Blacks is given to members of Rugby Union Football teams which represent New Zealand. It came into vogue during the 1905 tour of the British Isles by the `Original' All Blacks, as that team is now called. According to the statement (July 1964) ofW.J. Wallace (q.v.), one of the four surviving members of the 1905 team, the title was the result of a printer's error. It appears that R.J. Seddon (q.v.), then Premier of New Zealand, had arranged with the Daily Mail (London) to cover the tour, with the result that a reporter, Buttery, travelled everywhere with the team. After the match against the Hartlepool Clubs on 11 October 1905, at West Hartlepool, which New Zealand won 63-0, Buttery reported that the whole team, backs and forwards alike, had played with speed and precision as if they were `all backs'. This comment was repeated after the Northumberland game on 14 October (31-0) and the Gloucester City Club match on 19 October (44-0). But when the New Zealand team arrived at Taunton to play Somerset County (21 October), they found the whole town placarded with posters welcoming the `All Blacks'. Buttery inquired into the matter and reported to the team's management committee that the printer had in error inserted and `l' in `Backs'. The name appealed and henceforth the players were known as All Blacks. -->Early Uniforms Printer's error aside, one may assume that the 1905 team which wore `all black' uniform - only recently adopted - would sooner or later receive such a name. The 1884 New Zealand team to tour Australia, and the first to go overseas, had for its uniform a dark blue jersey with a gold fernleaf over the left breast, dark knickerbockers, and stockings. It was certainly not `All Black'. In April 1893, however, when the New Zealand Rugby Union was established, it was resolved that the New Zealand representative colours should be `... Black Jersey with Silver Fernleaf, Black Cap with Silver Monogram, White Knickerbockers and Black Stockings.' This was the standard uniform for some years, though photographs of the 1894 and 1896 teams show that white shorts, and not knickerbockers, were worn. There is no photograph of the 1897 team in uniform - in the official photograph they are shown wearing long trousers - but in the New Zealand Graphic of 14 August 1897 there is a cartoon of a New Zealand footballer wearing a black jersey and white shorts. -->The `All Black' Uniform At some point between 1897 and 1901 there was a vital change, concerning which the records of the New Zealand Rugby Union are silent. But by 1901 the New Zealand team to meet New South Wales wore a black jersey (canvas top, no collar), silver fern (now neater and smaller), and black shorts and stockings. The `All Blacks' had arrived in fact, if not in name. -->The 1905 Tour When the 1905 tour of Britain began on 16 September the players were referred to as the New Zealand Football Team or, more simply, the New Zealanders, though occasionally terms such as `Maorilanders' and `Colonials' did service. When, however, the Hartlepool game of 11 October was reported in the Daily Mail by Buttery, there appears for the first time a reference to `All Black Play' and its complement, `All Black Cameraderie'. From then on the new name gradually won acceptance, so much so that by early November, following the match with Surrey (1 November), the Daily Mail made direct mention of the All Black team `that everybody is talking about'. It is also interesting to note that on 15 November 1905 the term `Blacks' had even appeared in the pages of Punch which printed a number of stanzas dealing with the shortcomings of Seddon, the last running as follows: Can it be your head is turned/ By your team of Rugby `Blacks'?/ Has the glory they have earned/ Set you trotting in their tracks?/ Well, it's not mere weight and gristle,/ You must also play the game,/ Or the referee may whistle/ And you'll have yourself to blame/ If you get a free kick where you don't expect the same./ Although the new name `caught on' so quickly in Britain, its acceptance in New Zealand was much slower. Seddon, for instance, with that political opportunism which both irritated and amused his opponents, followed up each victory with congratulatory cablegrams addressed to `the colony's football team' (mid-October) or `the New Zealand football team' (4 December). The newspapers were equally tardy in adopting the term but by 21 November the New Zealand Herald referred to the `Triumphal March of the Blacks'. A few weeks later (6 December) it headed a column `"All Black' Gossip"; editorially, however, it always used the more formal term, `New Zealand Footballers'. Thus on 5 March 1906, the day of the team's arrival at Auckland, the Herald editorially acclaimed the `New Zealand Footballers', but on the following day it headed its report of the official function of welcome with a bold double-column caption - `Return of the All Blacks'. Meanwhile, throughout the country special shop window displays and feature advertisements `to mark the return of the All Blacks' suddenly appeared. The `All Blacks' had indeed arrived. <i>(1966,Encyclopaedia of New Zealand, An,1/32-33</i>)

## All Whites
 
 <i>n.</i> the New Zealand international men's football team [a). In 1981 and at the World Cup in 1982 the All Whites wore a white uniform with three black strips along the shoulder and black edging so I'd be careful of any mention of removing the black strip. b). The booklet "by Gray and Becht" has the words "All White" in the title only. It was also "edited by Paul Elenio". It has no precise date but could have preceded the first newspaper reference. c). Nat. Lib. does not have Sunday Star or Christchurch Star for May 1892. d). The first Dominion ref. (13 May) is an article by Gray. The second ref (20 May) is a Press Association message. e). My betting is that Gray did originate the term; would be worth ringing him at the Dom to confirm. I could not find it any earlier than 13 May - before that and elsewhere after that references are to Kiwis or the New Zealand team.]

>  Apart from the rather curious term double All Black, recorded in DNZE from the 1960s and meaning a man who has represented New Zealand at both rugby union and cricket (even though our cricketers have never been called All Blacks), there were no other secondary formations for another 75 years, when the previously overshadowed soccer code in New Zealand enjoyed its finest hour as the national team against huge odds qualified for the 1982 World Cup in Spain.Since a black strip was especially unsuitable for the warm Asian venues of many of the qualifying games, the team broke with tradition and were kitted out in (virtually) all white, so that the All Whites in name were the All Blacks' opposites, being for a time genuine rivals for the public's attention. However in August last year Soccer New Zealand formally dropped this to date most durable of the names modelled on All Blacks (not without complaints from some of the stalwart players of the 1980s), citing the risk of adverse reaction overseas, that is to what might be perceived as a racially insensitive label. New Zealand has been reinstated as the soccer team's name, though administrators acknowledge that All Whites is likely to remain in more informal and unofficial reference. <i>(Jan 1999,NZWords,2(1) : 5</i>)

The `alluvial claim' was defined in the regulations as a claim not in the watercourse or stream-bed of a creek or river. `Ordinary claim' was a more suitable term than `alluvial claim' and `ordinary' was adopted in the revised regulations of 1867-8. <i>(1962,West Coast Gold Rushes,247</i>) [NOTES: May]

>  A.N.Z.A.C./ WHO SPOKE THE WORD FIRST?[heading] Nobody, except an occasional odd or eccentric person, disputes the fact that the word `Anzac' came from the initial letters of Australian and New Zealand Army Corps. as Mr C.W.Batten explained in No. 1 issue of `Quick March,' but there is an interesting difference ofopinion as to the first use of these initials as a word.Major Waite discusses the matter in a letter to the Editor of `Quick March,' thus: In a Wellington paper I notice that another soldier has claimed to be the originator of `Anzac.' This was an army cook, who, noticing so many stores coming off marked A.N.Z.A.C. said to his mates: `I wonder how many more of these ------ Anzacs are coming ashore here.' His mates took the thing up, and so the word `Anzac' originated. The poor cook is now dead, having been tapped on the head by an army mule. The cook perhaps is lucky to be dead. As a returned soldier he might have been miserable. Poor Anzac! This is the fourth story I have seen in print. (1) The late respected, but now deceased cook. (2) A warrant officer in an Australian Signal unit on the Peninsula. (3) In the `Anzac Book,' General Birdwood definitely states that when he took over the command of the Australian and New Zealand Army Corps in Egypt, he was asked to select a telegraphic code address for his Army Corps, and adopted the word `Anzac.' Later on, after the landing, he was asked by General Headquarters to suggest a name for the beach, and in reply he christened it `Anzac Cove.' (4) General Ian Hamilton states, in his preface to `Crusading at Anzac,' A.D. 1915, by Signaller Ellis Silas: `As the man who first, seeking to save himself trouble omitted the five full stops and brazenly coined the word Anzac, I am glad to write a line or two in preface to sketches which may help to give currency to that token throughout the realms of glory.' The four distinguished soldiers mentioned above (`Anzacs every one,' as the pantomime song has it) are in measure right. In this way: when the two divisions were made into an Army Corps, the full title was `Australian and New Zealand Army Corps.' In the army short cuts are always taken. (!!!Editor). Civilians are always mystified by `the D.A.D.O.S.' and `the D.A.Q.M.G.' It is easy to imagine the harassed adjutant of divisional artillery, or an overworked brigade-major writing A.N.Z.A.C. when referring to the Army Corps, and so, the first day after the formation of the Army Corps, busy soldiers in a hundred different places wrote the new word with full stops after each letter. Our landing was known as the Gaba Tepe landing. In the London Gazette away in June, 1915, the neighbourhood `of Gaba Tepe' was often referred to. The A.N.Z.A.C. was doing its best to hold its bit of country, and everything came addressed ANZAC - the General's letters as well as the cases of the above-mentioned chef.

>  <b>PUGSLEY</b> The `landing' or `Anzac Day' was first celebrated in 1916 with a memorial service, and games and sports among the men of the Expeditionary Force. It became a day of increasing sombreness as the years went by: `a day of wreaths, a day without work or play - even the hotel bars and race courses were closed'. So it was that `Anzac Day' had two meanings to New Zealanders. To the New Zealand public at home it was the legend created by Ashmead Bartlett's despatches, a proclamation to the world that a junior partner in the British Empire had come of age. Anzac Day became the symbol of our willingness to share the burdens of Empire and those that died were our payment for this. To the soldiers of the New Zealand Expeditionary Force, `Anzac Day' or the `Landing Day' was a myth, as 25 April was Australia's Day. They deserved the credit for gaining that foothold, and the New Zealand role came later. It was a legend created by a naval staff officer when he included `New Zealand' and `New Zealanders' wherever appropriate in Ashmead Bartlett's despatches. However, as the war went on and the toll mounted, each `Anzac Day' became the day the nation remembered its war dead. It became a symbol of something found in war, something akin to a passage Malone of Chunuk Bair had marked in Ruskin's Crown of Wild Olive: `I found, in brief, that all great nations learned their truth of word, and strength of thought, in war: that they were nourished in war, and wasted by peace, taught by war, and deceived by peace; trained by war and betrayed by peace - in a word, that they were born in war and expired in peace'. To the New Zealand soldiers Anzac Day became the touchstone to an identity, a sense of purpose, a growing recognition of themselves as New Zealanders. It is true that it was a day of sadness, of men gone, but there was also joy and comradeship. Comradeship was vital because it made the obscenities endurable. It overlaid the bitterness and suffering. Anzac Day was a day of shared experiences remembered. A day of competitions and sports, of a beer with mates, and a toast to those they had served with and loved. This was never recognised by the public at home. <i>(1984,Gallipoli: the New Zealand Story,353</i>)

Many meanings have been given for the name but with Maori names the true meaning can often be found only in a mythological story or in historical fiction illustrating either how the name was given or something of the ideas which prompted it. Aotearoa is made up of either two or three words, Aotea and roa or Ao tea and roa. Aotea could be the name of one of the canoes of the great migration, the great magellan cloud near the bright star Canopus in summer, a bird or even a food; ao is a cloud, dawn, daytime, or world; tea, white or clear,perhaps bright, while roa means long or tall. <i>(1966,Encyclopaedia of New Zealand, An,1 : 153</i>)

After 1870, most Maori referred to the country as Niu Tirani - a result of Pakeha settlers calling the three islands New Zealand. Sir Keith said that in all the written Maori he had read from last century the word Aotearoa had been used in only one newspaper. Te Wanaanga, published in Napier, used Aotearoa in the 1870s. Sir Keith said Maori often referred to New Zealand byusing `te motu nei' (in this island). Sir Keith said the literal translation of Aotearoa was `landof the long twilight'. The name may have come about because the early Polynesians were not used to the long evenings in New Zealand. <i>(Jul 17, 1988,Sunday Star (Auckland),A6</i>)

## Archey's frog
 
 <i>n.</i> a critically endangered, small, nocturnal, forest-dwelling, indigenous frog, <i>Leiopelma archeyi</i>, named after Sir Gilbert Archey, onetime Director of the Auckland Museum. [New Zealand native frogs are ancient and primitive. They are small, nocturnal, do not have a tadpole stage, have no external eardrums, have round eyes and do not croak.]

>  Due to their [sic] genetic distinctiveness, Archey's frog is the number one conservation priority on the international Evolutionary Distinct and Globally Endangered (EDGE) programme in a list of 100 endangered amphibians worldwide. <i>(Sep 2008,NZ Geographic,52</i>)

>  USE OF TERM `ART UNION' The use of the term art union was under discussion at a meeting of the Auckland Society of the Arts ... Some time ago a letter was sent to the Minister of Internal Affairs asking if the term could be restricted in its use to that originally intended, namely the disposal of works of fine art. In his reply the Minister said: `The term is well established and its meaning well known in the community, and therefore it is not thought necessary to make specific change at this juncture.' Commenting on the present use of the term, the president ... said that it was obviously incorrect and that the present `art unions' were really lotteries. <i>(Oct 28, 1947,Evening Post,8/1</i>)

>  How did the art union, now replaced by the Government's `Golden Kiwi' lottery, come by its name? Officers of the Internal Affairs Department said today they believed that under the law operating when the art unions began in 1929, raffles or lotteries could only have works of art for prizes. Alluvial gold had apparently qualified as a work of art and for some years the prizes were [pounds]4000 in alluvial gold, which had to be deposited in the Bank of New Zealand and paid for before any tickets could be sold. Cash finally replaced the alluvial gold prizes, but the name `art union' stuck. <i>(Dec 1, 1961,Evening Post,17</i>)

The art union proper as defined in the Gaming Act exists only to a limited extent in New Zealand, and is confined to a few academies or societies of fine arts. What has generally become known as the art union is the national lottery. The term `art union' is due to the fact that originally the prizes in the lottery were alluvial gold. These major art unions are now known as the Golden Kiwi lottery. .. In 1961 the Government decided to replace the art unions with the present Golden Kiwi lottery. <i>(1966,Encyclopaedia of New Zealand, An,3/347</i>)

## Auckland cove
 
 <i>n.</i> early nickname for an Aucklander

>  <b>THOMSON</b> ... it is worthy of notice, that the colonists, soon after the formation of all the settlements, acquired distinguishing epithets; thus there was an Auckland cove, a Wellington swell, A Nelson snob, a Taranaki exquisite, an Otago cockney, and a Canterbury pilgrim. These epithets, almost already forgotten, are too characteristic to be buried in oblivion, as each originated in some peculiarity of the leading colonists. The Otago settlers derived theirs from their ignorance of the country in which they lived; the Auckland people from their extensive Sydney connexions; andthe origin of the other names are sufficiently obvious without explanation. <i>(1859,Story of New Zealand, The,2/188</i>)

Under the old system, foremen of the various shipping companies stood on a small platform or block with the men awaiting employment before them and nominated those they required to work their own ships. The trouble with this `auction block' system, as it was called, was that each company tended to give preference to a certain group of men. It engaged the same men first all the time and employed others only when the preferred group were all at work. This meant very often the available work on the waterfront was not evenly shared; and that's what the bureau system tries to avoid. <i>(1948,Our Own Country,91</i>) [NOTES: from Korero, AEWS magazine]
