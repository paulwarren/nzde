## schnapper
 
 <i>n.</i> variant of snapper q.v.

>  <b>WILSON</b> SNAPPER ... The common name `snapper' was given to the fish by Captain Cook in 1770. He mistook it for a member of the true snapper family <i>Lutjanidae </i>, a group of fish with which he had become familar in American waters. Although he did mistake the fish Captain Cook spelt the name correctly, whereas many subsequent writers have used `schnapper' - an erroneous spelling of unknown origin. Perhaps some of the early snapper fishermen took bottles of schnapps along on their outings, hence going `schnapping'! <i>(1981,Fisherman's Bible,226</i>)

>  [species name] schnapper .. [scientific name] -- [other name(s)] See SNAPPER <i>Chrysophrys auratus </i> .. [other name(s)] schnapper, tamure. See also premium snapper [occas. BREAM] <i>(Jul 23, 1986,Codes for Species in NZ Waters</i>)

>  Bellamy's menu has qualified as the most snobbish of all State papers. Whenever the well-known New Zealand fish called snapper is an item of Parliamentary diet it is invariable [sic] spelled `schnapper.' The gourmets of the Food and Wine Society could be forgiven for such literary heresy, but the old prosaic spelling should be good enough for the dining-room in Parliament House. Incidentally, the legend is that the fish was given the name `snapper' by Captain Cook when he was here on his voyage of exploration in 1770. As he and the members of his crew leaned over the side of their galleon two centuries ago and threw their fishing lines into the waters off the New Zealand coast the fish used to snap at the bait. Hence the name snapper. <i>(Mar 5, 1956,Dominion,8</i>)

>  My reference in last week's column to the snobbishness of Bellamy's in using the spelling `schnapper' when that fish was on its menu has brought `bites' galore - from fish merchants to schoolmasters. Most of them, it is fair to say, have taken up the cudgels on behalf of Bellamy's, but none of them has disproved my argument that the correct spelling is `snapper.' ... Some historians support my Captain Cook theory, though there are others who place the first use of the name `snapper' at a later date, certainly not earlier. They think the name may have been given the fish by Captain W. L. Edwardson, the commander of a New South Wales Government cutter called the Snapper which was in New Zealand waters in 1822 and 1823 investigating sealing prospects. He gave the name Port Snapper to an inlet on Ruapuke Island in Foveaux Strait. Whatever the origin of the word, the fish served at Bellamy's is indigenous to New Zealand and is spelt `snapper.' <i>(Mar 12, 1956,Dominion,8</i>)

>  The fishing off the island is very good, there being abundance of hapuku, kohikohi, maumau, schnapper, kahawai, tarakihi, in addition to plenty of shell-fish such as koura or cray-fish, crabs, paua,etc. <i>(1885,TrNZI,17/419</i>) [NOTES: (Goldsmith)]

>  <b>SHERRIN</b> SCHNAPPER (<i>Pagrus unicolor </i>). ... Dr. Hector says: `There are few fishes better known in the northern parts of the Colony than the schnapper.

>  <b>MORRIS</b> <i>Schnapper </i> or <i> Snapper </i>... a fish abundant in all Australasian waters, <i>Pagrus unicolor </i>, Cuv. and Val. The latter spelling was the original form of the word (one that snaps). It was gradually changed by the fishermen, perhaps of Dutch origin, to <i>Schnapper </i>, the form now general. The name <i>Snapper </i> is older than the settlement of Australia, but it is not used for the same fish. `O.E.D.,' s.v. <i>Cavally </i>, quotes: ... In New Zealand, the <i>Tamure </i> (q.v.) is also called <i>Schnapper </i>, and the name <i>Red-Schnapper i </i>s given to <i>Anthias richardsoni </i>, Gunth., or <i> Scorpis hectori </i>, Hutton. <i>(1898,Austral English,404</i>)

## scotia
 
 <i>n.</i> a (usually concave) moulding between a wall and a ceiling. [Jim Cameron writes: NSOD, Collins and Chambers define <i>scotia</i> as a concave/hollow moulding, esp. at the base of an (ionic) column. The OED definition is "a hollow moulding = casement". The latest citation (1878) reads "another kind of base is frequent in which a bead is subsituted for the scotia". <i>Casement</i> in turn is defined in the relevant sense as "a hollow moulding, a cavetto, not exceding one quarter round". <i>Cavettos</i>, it appears, are "principally used in cornices". All this is a bit obscure, but the definitions in NSOD etc would suggest a fairly uncommon word. The ordinary NZ use is specialised though common, and familar to most homeowners - a (usually concave) moulding between a wall and a ceiling. In NZ, it is standard and as well-known as <i>skirting board</i>.]

But the senses also parallel those of words with similar meanings: to wipe (off) (a person or thing), get wiped; wash out (sthg), a wash-out; to write off (sbdy or sthg), a write-off. The word seems noticeable after WW2, so perhaps it was popularised by NZ servicemen who may have picked it up from British Servicemen (or Australians): cf P.4.

>  <b>GRAHAM</b> SEAPERCH (POHUIAKAROA) JOCK STUART, HIGHLANDER, FIVEFINGER, SOLDIERFISH or SCRODDIE <i>Helicolenus papillosus</i> (Bloch and Schneider) The seaperch is a fish well known to all fishermen both sports and commercial fishermen alike, who give it quite a number of vernacular names, a few of which are as follows: Jock Stuart, Highlander, Fivefinger and Soldierfish. These names have a bearing on some distinguishing characteristic of the fish. For instance the first two names are supposed to be given on account of the colouring of the fish resembling, in some ways, the tartan of a Scot; while Fivefingers is given on account of the so-called five (really more) fingers (rays) of the pectoral fins, on which the fish has a habit of resting on the floor of the aquarium tank. The name Soldierfish is derived from the similarities of this fish to the activities of a soldier or picket on sentinel duty. I have often seen Seaperch stand or, rather, rest at attention on its pectoral fins for lengthy periods. When it did move, it moved to the right or to the left with the precision of a well-trained soldier. The name Scroddie, commonly used at the northern end of the South Island, is derived from the word Scrod which means a young Dogfish. It appears from my researches that when the early colonists first saw a small Seaperch they at once named it Scrod and later the `ie' was tacked on to make Scroddie. <i>(1956,NZ Fishes: An Identification Guide,344</i>)

## seal's ballast
 
 <i>n.</i>

>  Anyone who had ever been about old whaling and sealing stations must have seen collections of round smooth stones of various sizes but mostly about the size of cannon-balls, lying on the beach. On asking any of the `old hands' what these are, you will at once be told that they are `seal's ballast' ... You will probably be gravely told that the seal is a migratory animal, and that when it is about to take a long journey it will trim itself to exactly the proper weight for long and easy locomotion through the water. It picks up one of these stones and swallows it and goes into the water to try the effect. If it finds it requires more ballast it comes ashore again and repeats the dose. If it has too much weight .... it vomits one or two of the stones out on the beach. Hence the stones are always termed `seals' ballast' <i>(1871,TrNZI,4/417</i>) [NOTES: (Otago)]

>  Steve Braunias's disparaging treatment of the Semple tank.. is regrettable because his mirth obscures the vehicle's many visionary qualities. A more thoughtfdul evaluation reveals the tank's iconic form and use of local materials to be a bold and witty precursor of Don Driver's installations and use of otherwise familiar "found objects", and of Jeff Thompson's skill in wrapping cultural artefacts in corrugated iron. <i>(May 22, 2004,Listener (New Zealand Listener),10</i>)

>  <b>WALL</b> Who first called these immigrants by this opprobrious name is not stated, but it seems to me most probable that the Pilgrims used it as a term of contempt, and [110] that the immigrants took it to themselves much as the `Old Contemptibles' ... adopted their enemies' names in a spirit of defiance. ... There arises the further question as to the origin of the word which ... has been explained as an Irish `shaughraun'. Now why should an Irish word have been used at that time by the English settlers in Canterbury? ... My belief is that the word was not originally `Shagroon' but `Shabroon', `shabberoon', `shabbaroon' (all spellings occur) which is on record from the 18th century onwards, meaning `a mean, shabby fellow', `a disreputable or mean-spirited fellow', and this, which would be probably familiar to the English Pilgrims, is just the sort of term which would naturally be used to describe their rivals. This `shabroon' derives from the slang `shab', a low fellow, recorded as early as 1637, and no doubt closely alied to the standard `shabby', and ultimately from `shab' and `scab', two forms of the old English word. ... I conjecture that the `shabroon' [?does Wall mean `shagroon] of the English Pilgrims was by some pronounced with the `b' and by others with the `g', nobody ever having seen the word written or printed.

[title of Poem] 9.[NOTE 1866] 125. During the first year of the Settlement, Canterbury was invaded by a body of sheep-farmers from Port Philip (Victoria) who were regarded by the settlers partly with admiration as successful Colonists, and partly with horror as disbelievers in the art of colonisation and the `Canterbury System'. The visitors found the country admirably adapted for sheep-farming, and they treated with some contempt the raw emigrants from England who looked to agriculture as the foundation of their fortunes. One of the vistiors, who seem to have delighted in the soubriquet of `Shagroon', ventured to prophesy, in a letter, which found its way into print, that the `Canterbury Pilgrims' would soon be ruined and their country left for occupation by his more enlightened comrades. The `pilgrims' sought no harsher revenge than to nickname their Port Philip visitors `prophets' and to take example from their experience in pastoral pursuits. The Canterbury pasturage system was quickly adapted to the requirements of sheepfarming on a large scale, and `pilgrims' and `prophets' were soon merged into one class of Canterbury runholders.]

>  <b>PRATT</b> In the `Dream of a Shagroon' which bore the date Ko Motinau, April 1851, and which first appeared in the `Wellington Spectator' of May 7th, the term Pilgrim was first applied to the settlers; it was also predicted in it that the `Pilgrims', would be `smashed' and the `Shagroons' left in undisputed possession of the country for their flocks and herds. <i>(1877,Colonial Experiences,234</i>)

What this title is derived from is not quite clear.

The 50 per cent sharemilker runs his own herd of cows on another man's land. He does all the farm work, and receives 50 per cent of the profits.

>  Sir, - I read `The Dominion's' second editorial of Jauary 25, `Our `She'll-Be-Right' Attitude,' with interest, but as a Grim Dig I feel that it is my duty to point out to the younger generation the origin and meaning of the expression `she's right' `She's right' or `She'll-Be- Right' originated in the Army and was only used when the person using the saying was satisfied that he had done his particular job to the best of his ability and took pride in it. If, on the other hand, he had done the job to the best of his ability but he was not satisfied with the job, he used the phrase `She's not too good' or `She's pretty poor' Never was the phrase `She's right' used in the sense that politicians and various other people not in the know use it to refer to a job badly done or done with a `couldn't-care-less' attitude. This was never necessary because in the Army we had other phrases to cover such contingencies when things did not go according to plan, such as NAFU and SAFU, the first being a non-adjusting fiasco, and the second being a self-adjusting fiasco. To say the least of it, I feel strongly that it is disrespectful to the originators of the saying `She's right' to use it in the present accepted sense, and I feel also that all Grim Digs should rise up in righteous wrath, but `don't do your scone boys.'

## shellfish
 
 <i>n.</i> [An Australian lexicographer points out there is a difference between most dictionary definitions and what the public see as a shellfish; likewise in NZ the fishery regulations define for their convenience shellfish as including, from memory, crayfish, sponges and possibly even sea-grass.

The present OED definition is: Any animal living in water whose outer covering is a shell, whether testaceous, as an oyster, or crustaceous, as a crab. This wording is followed by Random House and Macquarie whereas the general public and scientists tend to think of a shellfish as a member of the class Mollusca, i.e. mostly animals with a hard calcareous shell or shells.]

>  <b>BEATTIE</b> The custom in the old days was to call the buildings on a run `the station,' and the land that went with it was `the run.' On a big property you could find several `stations,' and the principal one was called `the home station,' while the others were `out-stations.' This was the old Australian usage which was carried over to New Zealand at first, but gradually the signification was altered by loosely calling the whole run a station, and then the real station became a homestead and the out-stations became shepherds' huts. In this present book it will be noticed that generally the writer has preserved the olden custom of calling the main buildings the station and the land the run. The runs over in Australia being, as a rule, much larger than those in New Zealand, the `station' and `out-station' phraseology was preserved much longer than over here, where even in advertisements in the late 'fifties we see the English word `homestead' ousting the colonial word `station.' <i>Ibid.</i> 12 . provisions became `rations' ... when served out to the man at the `shepherds' huts' (or out-stations). <i>(1939,First White Boy Born in Otago,11</i>)

>  Votes of thanks were passed to Mr David Stevenson, Caversham, for promissory note by John Jones for GBP1, payable at Dunedin or Waikouaiti three days after date - those notes (sometimes called shin plasters) were in the form of a bank note, and were in circulation until January 2, 1857 ... <i>(Aug 5, 1908,Otago Witness,14</i>)

>  He hurled denunciations at the head of Sir John in particular, and the Stock Exchange in general, and in heroic language declared that New Zealand was a self-reliant, non-borrowing colony, and that Sir John and the Stock Exchange could depart for Sheol forthwith, and that he and Seddon and M'Kenzie could run the show by the aid of Consols, Postal notes, and shin plasters of a variety of patterns till further orders, and be d--d to him. <i>(Apr 19, 1895,Evening Post,4</i>)

>  A feature of the exhibit is a number of debentures or "shin plasters" as they were irreverently termed, which were put into circulation during the term of the governorship of Captain Fitzroy...

>  And Sir Samuel/Hoare - he goes / With shin plaster / On his nose ... <i>(Dec 18, 1935,Evening Post,8</i>)

>  <b>JOSEPH MASTERS</b> Many tradesmen [in the early 1840s] had to make their own money on strips of paper called by the settlers `shin plaisters'. Governor Grey [sic] established a bank issue and issued one pound promisery [sic] notes, to get change for one of these, you would get a hat full of shin plaisters. <i>(1871,Autobiography,26</i>)

>  <b>MACDONALD</b> I do not know exactly how wholesale mercantile business was carried on, but the retail business in the town [?Wellington] was carried on [c1840s] mostly by means of little bits of printed paper, issued by shopkeepers, for from one penny to two or three shillings. This currency went by the general name of `shin plaster'. <i>Ibid.</i> 117 When eggs fell from six silver shillings per dozen to one shilling of `shin plasters', the Hutt, Porirua Road and Karori settlers looked anxious. <i>(1910,Reminiscences,109</i>) [NOTES: c1840s in c1910 Macdonald Reminiscences (TS:VUW) 109]

>  <b>SUTHERLAND</b> <i>Shinplasters</i>.- The fact that private traders found it necessary themselves, to issue paper notes in denominations below five shillings suggests that at the outset ... the Fitzroy notes were not issued for values below five shillings. The private paper notes were issued for small change, redeemable mostly in `Five Shillings, in Government debentures.' Both the debentures and the private notes were issued on poor paper, and soon became known as `Government Rags' and `Shinplasters' respectively. The term `Shinplaster' for paper money appears to have come to New Zealand from America, via New South Wales. *[fn] In the latter Colony the issue of paper money of a denomination lower than twenty shillings was prohibited in 1826 to promote the circulation of sterling instead of a colonial currency, and the prohibition was welcomed by the people as `preventing the Colony being inundated with beggarly rags' and dollar and half-dollar notes `used often as a paltry contrivance to evade payment of debt,' <i>vide "The Australian," </i>19 July 1826. [fn] Various reasons have been given for the origin of this curious term for paper money issued in the forties. The most likely explanation comes from America (p. 650 <i>The Numismatist,</i> 1938), where it is stated that in the good old days post-boys and out-riders, wearing high boots, were required, at times, to pay toll-fees at toll-gates, and in order to facilitate progress they placed paper money or coins in bags in their boot-tops, against their shins - hence the term `shin-plaster.' <i>(1941,Numismatic History of NZ,158</i>)

>  <b>HARGREAVES</b> The [Governor Fitzroy's (1844)] Debentures, popularly known as `government rags', were given various nicknames such as<i> assignats,</i> `shinplasters', and `flash notes'. All these terms had reference to worthless paper money, some of which had been issued in the past. <i>Assignats</i> was the name given to large amounts of paper money issued in France during the French Revolution, but which depreciated to such as extent to be almost worthless. `Shinplasters' - sometimes written `skinplasters' - had its origin in North America, and again referred to depreciated paper money, while `flash notes' was a popular term in use for any counterfeit money or worthless forged paper money. <i>(1972,From Beads to Banknotes,40</i>)

>  Various chemical modes of cleansing have been tried with only partial success, but recently it was accidentally discovered that a current of electricity would almost immediately expel the troublesome impurities, no matter how abundant or how "sick" the mercury had been rendered. ..With the current flowing, the mercury could not be made sick. <i>(Nov 5, 1883,Evening Post,2</i>)

 <i>adj.</i> NZ colloquial usage follows US and earlier British usage in assigning a main sense of `ill, unwell, ailing' to this word, esp. in the phrase <i>be sick </i>; contrast modern British usage with main sense `vomit'. That is, NZ usage follows OED a. I 1. Suffering from illness of any kind; ill, unwell, ailing. Now chiefly literary and U.S. [9-19c]. rather than 2. Having an inclination to vomit, or being actually in the condition of vomiting [18-20c]. An ambiguous statement, e.g., `I was sick on Thursday' would usually be interpreted in NZ as `I was ill' etc; in Britain probably as `I vomited etc' (Dr. R. Savage); and this can lead to some immediately horrifying images for Englishmen in N.Z., needing quick reshuffling to extract the correct sense: e.g., I was sick in bed last Thursday. Unambiguous statements naturally assign themselves appropriate senses, mainly on aspectual grounds: I was sick twice before breakfast; I have been sick for months. `Ill' is often used in NZ by, e.g. mothers and nurses, as a euphemism for the `vomit' sense: Little Tommy has just been ill all over his shoes. (When used as a verb, sick is always `vomit': N.Coghill and C. Tolkien have an interesting note to l.71 of their edition of Chaucer's <i>The Nun's Priest's Tale </i> (Harrap pp 94-5). l. 71 Repleccioun [overeating] re made hire nevere sick `sick': `ill', not `sick'. The withering away of the old sense of sick is relatively recent, and has not taken place in America; cf also <i>sickbay, sickroom, a sick man,</i> etc. Chaucer knew the word <i>ill, but for him it was a word characteristic of the North and East of England (it was of Scandinavian origin), and he only used it to give an impression of dialect in the talk of John and Aleyn, the Two Cambridge students from the North of England in the Reeve's Tale; for them, in any case, it meant `bad, evil'. Chaucer's word for being sick (in our sense) was <i>spew</i>.'

>  <b>M.E. ALCOCK</b> I list below the words I can think of [as having different meanings in Britain and NZ]: <i>N.Z. English </i> Singlet Vest Sick Sick in England means to vomit.) <i>(Dec 3, 1957,Letter</i>)

 <i>v.</i> to negotiable a steep slope of a hill by going round the side of it rather than straight up to the crest. (probably a back form from SIDELING.)

>  To <i>sidle </i>, to go around the side or across the face of a hill, is a characteristic New Zealand expression, strange to the Englishman or Australian. The example of 1821 in O.E.D.: `Ye know the footpath sidles down the hill', suggests that something of the New Zealand meaning was not unknown in England, but it cannot have been well known, or mountaineers would not have started to use <i>traverse </i>, both as a noun and as a verb, towards the end of last century. <i>Sidle </i> is well known among high-country musterers. As it is a word most likely to be used in open hilly or mountainous country, one may guess that musterers and up-country people gave it currency, whence it was adopted by mountain club people. If ski-ing had not brought its more or less international vocabulary with it we should no doubt be sidling slopes, on skis, that we now traverse... From 1936 to 1938 in <i>The Tramper </i> there are a number of references to `sidling tracks' and `sidling routes'. Towards the end of 1938 comes `after sidling round the head of the said stream', and, a year later, `we sidle the top of Three Johns', and from then on the verb flourishes. In 1940 comes `on a long sidle', and from then on the noun is as common as the verb. <i>Ibid.</i> 41 From the top basin we sidled up tiresome scree, ... and at last emerged on the top of the divide. <i>(Sep 1958,Tararua,29</i>) [NOTES: Ruth Mason `Track and Trail']

>  Often, with back bent low, he must thread [sic] the dirty overgrown bed of a steep little watercourse, or, still with back bent, sidle along the muddy slope of a steep hill, through a tunnel in the koromiko copse; or, straightening his back with a sigh of relief as he emerges on the open shingle-bed, find that he has to ford and ford again and again the cold rapid stream, slipping ahd splashing over weed-covered stones. <i>(Aug 18, 1862,Daily Southern Cross,3</i>)

>  A few blows with the tomahawk, a fire-stick judiciously employed, and, should the brook be high, a little sidling over a low bank or two, is the most that can be needed, though the gorge being very narrow, its aspect may at first appear discouraging for a mile or two. <i>(Jun 2, 1855,Nelson Examiner and New Zealand Chronicle,2</i>)

The ordinary man in the paddock in Canterbury recognises only three winds: <i> East </i> (from N.E.),<i> sou'wester </i> (from S.E., S. etc, S.W. etc), and nor'wester. <i> As a matter of fact a three-day so'wester usually only lasts two and a half.

Henceforward, echoed the <i>Colonial Gazette</i>, `the humbug treaty of Waitangi' would be `very properly laid on the shelf'. <i>(Jan 2, 1847,Wellington Spectator</i>) [NOTES: 1847 Jan 2 Wellington Spectator in 1958 Miller Early Victorian NZ 149]

 <i>n.</i>

>  <b>SUTTON-SMITH</b> In the nineteenth century the ring game seems to have been the most popular marble game. (In more recent years marble games with holes have had the greater role.) There was Big Ring, in which a circle a yard or more in diameter was drawn on the ground; there was the mullibar variation, in which an outsize taw was catapulted amongst the marbles in this circle. There were Little Ring, Liney, Follows, Follow the Taw, Holey, and then, on a less important scale, Butcher's Board, in which the marbles were bowled through the holes in a board, Eye-Drop, Knock-Backs, Leggings-Out (or Leggin's-Out), Span-'Em, and Backits. The last was more usually a girls' game. <i>(1972,Folkgames of Children,174</i>)



## spang-weazling
 
 <i>n.</i>

>  Perhaps the most intriguing game of this nature [sc. tormenting insects or animals] is `Spang Weazling'. This game was played at Denniston in 1930-35. A crawley was placed on the end of a stick the middle section of which lay balanced over a stone. Before the crawley could crawl off the stick a stone had to be thrown onto the other end of the stick so as to catapult the crawley off the stick and over the cliff. A variation of the same game was being played at Denniston when I visited there in 1949. It was called alternatively `Hit the Crawley' or `Strike the Crayfish'. In this version the other end of the stick was hit with a batting stick (as in Tip Cat) and when the crawley was catapulted into the air it was hit again with the bat. <i>(1953,Unorganized Games,1/406</i>)

There was a good deal of scrub in the bends of the Mataura known as `wire plant' (Olearia virgata). There were also manuka and koromiko. Maori-heads, a kind of grass tree about three feet high, abounded in the swamps, and in some we saw toitoi grass and raupo. We did not pass any cabbage trees to-day ... we proceeded slowly through tomatakuru scrub, speargrass, Spaniard, snowgrass, and other native grasses ... we camped in a bend with good feed at the Elbow and a swamp on one side.

>  [Fantastic names of plants] show the imagination running riot; they seem appropriate, though often it is impossible to give any definite reason for the name. ... `Spaniard' [like `Wild-Irishman' is] another name of unexplained origin. There seems even less connection between the human Spaniard and the vegetable spaniard than between the human wild Irishman and the vegetable wild-irishman; and the conjectured corruption `spine-yard', whilst improbable, is no more improbable than the fabled `Bill's-yard' as the origin of `billiard' <i>(1926,TrNZI,663</i>) [NOTES: Andersen Pop.

 <i>n.</i> (See [cf. spot v](../S#spot-v),[spoiling; gridironing](../S#spoiling;-gridironing))

>  <b>OLIVER</b> The runholder was protected against intruders: cottages, fences and homesteads gave him a pre-emptive right over a set number of contiguous acres. Fences and cottages could be so disposed as to give the runholder rights over the best of the land - sources of water and wood, strips surrounding isolated and thus inaccessible pockets. `Grid-ironing' and `spotting', as these selective practices were called, were certainly used by many runholders to tie up large areas, but probably not to the extent alleged by horrified land tenure radicals in later years. <i>(1968,Story of New Zealand, The,108</i>)

>  <b>CRAWFORD</b> `Gridironing' was the practice of buying twenty acre sections fronting on a road, so spaced as to leave sections of nineteen acres between them, and as these had to be auctioned the small farmer stood litttle chance of outbidding the run-holder who usually retained them without having to purchase them. `Spotting' was buying up key positions, fertile land, and leaving the barren, water courses, entrances to valleys, road lines, ... . <i>(1949,Sheep and Sheepmen of Canterbury,94</i>)

These practices called gridironing and spotting can be defended: there is no need to do so here. If spotting is practiced - the purchase of selected areas with water and shelter for the control this gave over the surrounding country - a study of the Crown grant index maps and of the dates of the original titles supplies no evidence of it. <i>(1948,Run, Estate and Farm,13</i>)

## sprag
 
 <i>v.</i> to catch, spike, snag the flesh or clothing on a protruding spike of wire, metal, etc. [(The NZ sense of <i>sprag </i> n and v would seem to derived from a dialect variant of <i>sprig </i>: cf.

Years later, when I had forgotten it, I suddenly met it again, and again I recoiled. So aghast was I that I spent weeks collecting every old term for `runholders' I could, and I found thirteen, viz., `flock owners,' `flock masters,' `pastoralists,' `run holders,' `run owners,' `sheep owners,' `sheep holders,' `sheep masters,' `squatters,' `station holders,' `station owners,' `stock holders,[sic] and `stock owners.' The word `sheepmen' is a modern Americanism, and using this anachronism mars a splendid memorial. ...

In Australia the word had at first the sense of a settler without title; but its use was gradually extended to persons who occupied crown land for sheep raising under a lease or a license, and afterwards to those also who held their sheep runs as freehold. Finally the word became the common name for a sheep farmer, whether occupying leasehold or freehold property. It is, however, giving way to the newer term <i> pastoralist </i>. <i>(1898,Merriam-Webster Third International,2031</i>)

## squatting interest
 
 <i>n.</i>

>  This was in November, '57; and from that date the supporters of Wellington policy gradually dwindled away; for, as most of them were connected with the squatting interest, the proceedings of the Wakefield Reform Association against the runholders had the effect of inducing those gentlemen to join in the demand for separation; so that, when the New Provinces Act became law, in 1858, the settlers of Ahuriri almost unanimously determined to take advantage of its provisions. <i>(Oct 5, 1861,Hawke's Bay Herald,6</i>)

 <i>n.</i> [aka squatter system]

>  The land reformer who opposed the squatting system which gave the pastoral tenant a small principality at a nominal rent, argued with energy and ability, that by adopting a methodic system of cultivation [sic] English and other grasses on pastoral land, the productiveness of the land would be increased tenfold, and prove a preventative to scab, and the other diseases that afflict stock that are kept for a length of time on virgin pasture. <i>(Dec 31, 1866,Southland Times,2</i>)

This process, repeated in its infinite variations, can produce an exquisite cave decor, a tanbtalising display of beauty comparable perhaps only with the artwork of hoar frost.

>  <i>Station, n.</i> Sometimes <i>sheep s., cattle- s.</i>, or <i>dairy-s</i>., (PAUL, p. 68); originally the hut, yards, and buildings where a squatter stationed himself to work his run; but now usually the whole property, including the stock and leasehold country. It has been used in both these senses in Australia (whence the word came) since the 'thirties. ([1898 Morris Austral-English]) (1) The original sense is still preserved up country, where the men always speak of <i>in at the s</i>., when they are out on the run; also in the word <i>out-s</i>. (q.v.), which has no other meaning than the house, yards etc. (2) The secondary sense of a property with freehold, leasehold, buildings, and stock. (3) Any fairly large property, carrying over 2000 or 3000 sheep. (4) Adjective as in s.horse, belonging to the owner, not to one of the man, whose horses are<i> private; s. sheep</i>, not one belonging to a neighbour; <i>s.-bred,</i> not a bought sheep. (5) Since the 1890s, auctioneers in their advertisements have taken to speaking of <i>s. lines</i> of sheep, though 70 per cent. of those so designated at the autumn ewe fairs come from farms or grazing runs. ([1898 Morris Austral-English]) <i>(Dec 16, 1933,Press, The,21</i>) [NOTES: Acland Glossary]

>  <b>BEATTIE</b> The custom in the old days was to call the buildings on a run `the station,' and the land that went with it was `the run.' On a big property you could find several `stations,' and the principal one was called `the home station,' while the others were `out-stations.' This was the old Australian usage which was carried over to New Zealand at first, but gradually the signification was altered by loosely calling the whole run a station, and then the real station became a homestead and the out-stations became shepherds' huts. In this present book it will be noticed that generally the writer has preserved the olden custom of calling the main buildings the station and the land the run. The runs over in Australia being, as a rule, much larger than those in New Zealand, the `station' and `out-station' phraseology was preserved much longer than over here, where even in advertisements in the late `fifties we see the English word `homestead' ousting the colonial word `station.' <i>(1947,Early Runholding in Otago,11</i>)

>  It is usually understood that in the early days the word `station' denoted the owner's house and its immediate buildings, while `run' meant the whole property. Strange to say, I only noted the word `station' twice, and each time with a diverse meaning. On July 21, 1865, the diary says: `Sold 17 head of cattle - remaining on station 15 head.' Then on September 11, 1865, we read: `Wilkinson returned to the Home Station.' The first of these entries means the whole run - the second the homestead or main buildings. <i>(Jul 21, 1856,Puketoi Station Diary</i>) [NOTES: 1947 Beattie Early Runholding 115 quoting 1856 July 21 Puketoi Station Diary]

[249] So far as I could discriminate, swaggers (those who, snail-like, carry their worldly possessions on their backs) are men occasionally willing to do a day's work for a night's lodging and a couple of meals. Sundowners (those who have no possessions to carry) walk from station to station during the day, and, sleeping under a haystack until sunset, make their appearance at that hour before the `whares' or huts provided for them, and demand from the owners supper and shelter, which are generally granted. <i>(1894,In the Land of the Tui,248, 249</i>) [NOTES: 1891 Dec 21 in 1894 Land of the Tui]

>  <b>BRADSHAW</b> fn The term `swagger' is applied to a man who tramps from place to place in quest of work, carrying all his worldly goods in a swag, or bundle, thrown across his back. The `sun-downer' is one who tramps from place to place pretending to seek employment, but, as a matter of fact living upon the supper and breakfast with which he is supplied at most up-country stations. He fears to arrive too early in the day, lest he should be requested to seek a bed elsewhere, and hence the name with which he has been endowed. <i>(1888,New Zealand Of Today,181</i>)

>  <b>PYKE</b> Now, a `sundowner' or `tussocker' for the terms are synonymous - is a pastoral loafer; one who loiters about till dusk, and then makes for the nearest station or hut, to beg for shelter and food. <i>(1873,Wild Will Enderby,Bk III ch x 105</i>) [NOTES: (1889)]

>  <b>D'AVIGDOR</b> Those who join it [the professional unemployed] are distinguished from `sundowners' ... by working chiefly in towns instead of in the open country, and in swarms instead of alone.
