Kawanatanga is subject to a promise to protect Rangatiratanga. Rangatiratanga is subject to an acknowledgment of Kawanatanga. The working out in practice of the balance between the two Articles must depend upon a case by case consideration. ... It is the right of all citizens, Maori, Pakeha, and other New Zealanders, that there be effective Government or Kawanatanga in such matters. <i>(1989,Principles for Crown Action,7</i>)

In proof of this they assert that, when felling huge ratas, they often find a dead tree in the centre of the rata: this is a common occurrence, but it by no means follows that this species is a climber.

>  <b>MORRIS</b> <i>Rata, n.</i> Maori name for two New Zealand erect or sub-scandent flowering trees, often embracing trunks of forest trees and strangling them: the Northern Rata, <i> Metrosideros robusta </i> , A. Cunn., and the Southern Rata, <i> M. lucida </i> , Menz., both of the N.O. <i> Myrtacea </i> . The tree called by the Maoris Aka, which is another species of <i> Metrosideros (M. florida)</i> , is also often confused with the Rata by bushmen and settlers. In Maori, the adj. <i> rata </i> means red-hot, and there may be a reference to the scarlet appearance of the flower in full bloom. The timber of the Rata is often known as <i> Ironwood </i> , or <i> Ironbark </i> . The trees rise to sixty feet in height; they generally begin by trailing downwards from the seed deposited on the bark of some other tree near its top. When the trailing branches reach the ground they take root there and sprout erect. For full account of the habit of the trees, see quotation 1867 (Hochstetter), 1879 (Moseley), and 1889 (Kirk). <i>(1898,Austral English,380</i>)

>  If he were sure he could recognise it, writes Mr T. P. Moloney, he would gather rauriki and get his wife to cook it, for he enjoyed it years ago in Maori cooking, in the King Country, where it was called by the pakeha `Maori cabbage.' <i> Rauriki </i> is the common succulent thistle, growing 2ft to 3ft high, that the children gathering it for pet rabbits and guinea pigs, call milk thistle, because of the abundant flow of milky white sap from it. Actually there are two species' Sonchus oleraceus, whose lobed leaves are only mildly prickly and flat, or at the most very slightly waved at the edges, and S. asper, very similar except that the leaves are much more prickly, and are waved or crimped around the edges. The flowers are yellow, rather like those of a dandelion, about three-quarters of an inch in diameter. <i> Chewing Gum </i> According to some people, rauriki is the Maori name of the former and puwha of the latter, but I do not know that the Maoris went in for such nice distinctions. Different tribes had different names for the same thing. Puwha, as well as being one of the names for the sow thistle, seems to have been also used sometimes as a general term for any cooked greens, of which sow thistle was the favourite. <i>(Jan 7, 1963,Otago Star</i>) [NOTES: (I.W.T. Munro on `Maori Cabbage')]

>  At Oxford, Makereti (Maggie Papakura) wrote: `I myself gather the sow thistle here and cook it to eat, as it reminds me of our own puwha, of which I am very fond. Puwha was used only as a vegetable ... The succulent stems contained a bitter milky juice which came to the surface when the flower tops were plucked off. This was left, on a sunny day, for a few hours, then gathered between the thumb and first finger, adding the thick creamy mass of several plants together. This was used as a sort of chewing gum, called pia or ngau, which tasted very bitter at first. But after a little chewing, the bitterness disappeared, and this gum was much enjoyed, especially by the women, who vied with each other in seeing who could make her pia crack the loudest.' <i>(Jan 7, 1963,Otago Star</i>)

 <i>n.</i>

>  Belich divides the period covered by the volume, the 1880s to the present, into three broad phases: the progressive colonisation which was the dominant feature of <i>Making Peoples</i>; the rise of recolonisation, which tightened the relations between Britain and colonies up to the 1960s and made them co-owners of imperial culture and heritage; and finally decolonisation, the period since the 1960s in which New Zealand has achieved economic diversification, greater independence in foreign policy and a great socio-demographic "coming-out" of difference. <i>(Nov 17, 2001,Listener (New Zealand Listener),57</i>)

>  The red-band rule of thumb (a waterway that is deeper than a red-band gumboot or too wide to jump) allows for a farmer to opt out of planting these crucial small streams. On most farms, even a large river narrows to the point where it could be stepped across. Similarly there will be a wide point where even a larger river can be crossed wearing red-bands. <i>(Jul 7, 2008,NZ Herald,13</i>)

>  That Sir Joseph Ward appears to realise that the strike is going to have its effect upon the general election is evident from a statement which he has made to the Ashburton "Guardian." "Farmers in the North Island," he said, "were giving their whole-hearted support to the Liberals, and although the Prime Minister was endeavouring to make party capital out of 'Red-Fedism,' the farmers had not forgotten that the Government had helped to secure the return of active supporters of the Red-Fed. movement." <i>(Nov 23, 1914,Grey River Argus,5</i>)

The value of the wash up is determined by the amount of gold or other metal caught in the riffles or other devices. <i>(1935,Gold Mining Year Book,11</i>)

>  <b>MAY</b> RIFFLE OR RIPPLE: both terms were used for the grooves cut across the bottom of a sluice-box or for the much more common wooden bars fixed at right angles, obliquely, or lengthwise, to the bottom of a sluice. The `riffleboard' was detachable and formed a `false bottom'. `Riffle' was probably a Californian term; `ripple' seems to have been more usual on the goldfields of Australasia. <i>(1967,West Coast Gold Rushes,528,1962 ed.</i>)

>  <b>ACLAND</b> Merino sheep on the flat, especially when coming to a gate, are apt to circle. The centre of the mob may stand still, or move slowly forward; but the outside sheep gallop round and round them. This is called ringing. It is annoying to see the sheep racing past the gate instead of going through it, but the habit may be turned to the shepherd's advantage. By starting the sheep on one side ringing the reverse way, two streams of sheep can be made to meet at the gate, and carry one another through. <i>(1933,Press, The</i>)

>  <b>WEEKES</b> The natives here [in Taranaki] are in fear of their old enemies the `Wicatus' coming, but it appears their visit is intended for a friendly one, or to ringa-ring (shake hands). <i>Ibid.</i> t 68 They [Maoris] were very civil, indeed the habit of shaking hands with every one became at last disagreeable, for if you met them a dozen times a day the ringa-ring must not be omitted, ... <i>(May 2, 1841,Journal</i>) [NOTES: 1841 May 2 Weekes Journal in 1940 Establishment of New Plymouth 49]



## ringanui
 
 <i>n.</i> a groundwater crustacean [ORIGIN: Maori, The name <i>Ringanui</i> is derived from the Maori words <i>ringa</i> (hand) and <i>nui</i> (big) in reference to the very large gnathopod 1 characteristic of this genus. **The name <i>toonuiiti</i> is derived from Maori <i>toonui</i> (thumb) and <i>iti</i> (little) and refers to the smaller robust seta defining the proximal end of the gnathopod 1 palm... **The name <i>koonuiroa</i> is derived from Maori <i>koonui</i> (thumb) and <i>roa</i> (long) and refers to the very large robust seta defining the proximal end of the gnathopod 1 palm...]

>  The new genus, Ringanui, is a significant step in resolving this confusion. Ringanui differs from Paraleptamphopus on several characters and is most easily recognised by diverse gnathopods, the first of which is enlarged relative to gnathopod 2. The two species are described and illustrated in detail. They differ in size and gnathopod characteristics, but other differences are small. Ringanui koonuiroa is the smaller species and is most easily recognised by the single, very long robust seta defining the palm of gnathopod 1. The second species, R. toonuiiti, is the larger, but its palmar defining spine is relatively short. <i>(2006,Internet - see Notes</i>) [NOTES: http://www.mapress.com/zootaxa/2006f/z01148p025f.pdf Accessed on 14/03 2006]

>  At the native meeting up the river the diversity of religions caused some discussion. There are four religions altogether, Protestant (Church of England), Catholic, Salvation Army, and Te Kooti's religion (Ringatu). The latter is a bugbear to some of the natives, particularly the Catholics, but the meeting decided on freetrade in this matter, the main argument being that as Englishmen had hundreds of religions there was no reason why the Maoris should not have at least four. ..

If they had been sheep farmers they would probably have used the English or Scotch sheep farming words (as they did to some extent) and fitted them to the new conditions. If they had been scientists they would have invented exact names for everything new, and translated them into Latin. What they did do was to take the handiest word they could think of and give it a new meaning, As time went on the word they had chosen changed or extended its meaning. The best example of all this is the word run. <i>(Nov 18, 1933,Press, The,15</i>) [NOTES: >Acland's senses 1 and 5 seem to be the central ones, with the others being specialisations of, or obvious inferences from those. -->cf also Morris]

>  <b>MORRIS</b> Run, n. (1) Tract of land over which sheep or cattle may graze. It is curious that what in England is called a sheep-walk, in Australia is a sheep-run. In the Western United States it is a sheep -ranch. Originally the squatter, or sheep-farmer, did not own the land. It was unfenced, and he simply had the right of grazing or `running' his sheep or cattle on it. Subsequently, in many cases, he purchased the freehold, and the word is now applied to a large station- property, fenced or unfenced. (See quotation, 1883.) [1826] <i>(1898,Austral English,397</i>)

>  <b>TURNER</b> First a run is a parcel of land as leased. A sheepfarmer might own several adjacent runs of land, in this sense, and the whole `station' so formed might also be termed a run. In the third sense a run was leasehold as opposed to freehold land; in a fourth sense, open land as opposed to fenced land. It might be used as an adjective, e.g. run cattle. It might be the equivalent of station but without including the sheep, i.e. `He sold his run' need not imply that he sold his sheep, but `He sold his station' would. <i>(1966,English Language in Aust. & NZ, The,50</i>)

>  run: [1] This word has several uses but the most common refers to a stretch of work. The official shearing time of two hours is called a `run'.
