>  Yields of Wairau in these trials were not affected by wilt, and Saranac yielded as much as Wairau.

Saranac is a coarser lucerne than Wairau and not so good for producing high-quality hay. <i>(Oct 1974,NZ Journal of Agriculture,47</i>)

>  Figures for the 1982-83 season show it yielded the same from four cuts as the other home-grown varieties, Wairau and Rere. <i>(Nov 1986,NZ Journal of Agriculture,22</i>)

>  Wairau - standard New Zealand cultivar, well adapted to both cutting and grazing. <i>(1995,Grasslands Range of Forage and Conservation Plants,10</i>)

 <i>n.</i> a confederation of iwi ["Maori iwi are usually grouped into confederations, which are named after ancestral canoes (i.e.waka) which are said to have come from Hawaiki. The best known are Tainui and Arawa, but there are others (and I can't help noticing the recent term for Northland confederation is Tai Tokerau which is not a canoe). The use arises because traditionally a Maori might have a number of iwi affiliations. (I was once told that when asked their iwi in the Muruwhenua area, locals tend to look down at the ground and give the iwi in whose rohe they are standing, because they belong to all the Muriwhenua iwi). Thus the waka in the quotations [in <i>Kotare</i>]presumably refer to the notion of waka as confederations - which is not a bad way to think of political parties. And waka jumping is I take as heinous as announcing you are Arawa rather than the Tainui you once proclaimed (in the middle of a battle). (Brian Easton, 12/12/1999)]

## wash-house
 
 <i>n.</i> [Jim Cameron writes: <i>Wash-house</i> is defined in NSOD as an outhouse or room where domestic washing is done. Collins tags it as <i>formerly</i> a building or outhouse.

Subsequently it came fully into the house and was rechristened laundry. But the term is still extant in the old sense, and not uncommon. ?NZ certainly much used until recently.]

>  <b>MAY</b> `West Coast' continued to be used in the 1860's, but after 1864 the official names, `West Canterbury' and `Nelson South West', had some popular currency. Then a further complication was introduced. In 1859 John Rochfort had had coined the name `West land', a shortened form of `Westmoreland', the name he used on a map showing his West Coast explorations. After August 1865 the form `Westland' was resurrected and was used both for electoral and judicial districts which covered part or whole of the West Coast. Popularly, however, `Westland' was used chiefly for West Canterbury; the remainder of Canterbury Province was sometimes called `Eastland'. West Canterbury became the County of Westland in 1868 and the Province of Westland five years later. The Nelson South-West Goldfield kept this official name until 1876 when the provinces were abolished. <i>(1967,West Coast Gold Rushes,14,1962 ed.</i>)

>  <b>MAY</b> `West Coast' remains the popular term for the strip of country on the wrong side of the Southern Alps, though recently New Zealand geographers have adopted `Westland' for the whole West Coast. Whatever its merits, this term is unsatisfactory. It has some popular currency south of Greymouth, and it may acquire popularity through its teaching in the schools; but at an indefinable point north of Greymouth one is likely to be told, `This isn't Westland, this is the Buller'. A region itself so distinctive is also marked by strong local feeling. In 1960 `Westland' celebrated its centenary; `the Buller' did not. <i>(1967,West Coast Gold Rushes,15</i>)

>  <b>VON HAAST</b> He explained to his readers that there were two kinds of diggings, the `wet' and the `dry'. The first were in the bed of the river, the water of which had often to be diverted in order that the diggers might wash the gold taken out. If these diggings offer a larger profit to those who strike the right spot, they have the disadvantage, that the necessary labour is hard and unhealthy, for the diggers must often stand breast-high in the cold water from the mountains. ... The dry diggings, which generally require more capital and strength, are to be found mostly on the heights or in the higher diluvium. The water must often be brought long distances in sluices. The earth containing the gold is thrown into the sluices, in which a double floor with numerous bored openings lie. <i>(1948,Julius Von Haast</i>) [NOTES: [c1860 <i>Weiner Zeitung (Vienna) Nos 57-65 in German] in 1948 Von Haast Sir Julius Von Haast 35 Weiner Zeitung</i>, 1860]]

The final words were the cry "Whaddarya? Whaddarya? Whaddarya?", as eloquent an interrogation of our notions of masculinity as New Zealand literature has produced.... Maybe the original play (and especially its conclusion) was just too theatrical to be filmed.

>  The concept and meaning of whakamaa are difficult to explain concisely in English. However, the word is generally translated to mean one of these three things shy, embarrassed, or ashamed... Whakamaa most often occurs for Maori people, either as individuals or as members of a group, when they are placed in a situation where they perceive themselves to be at a disadvantage and thus to have a lower status. Whakamaa, therefore, has a lot to do with mana, which is most often translated by Maori people to mean power or authority... Third, utu or making amends requires restoring a person's or group's mana.

They were black and smooth in the hair as the mole of the Old Country, and were esteemed delicacies. They were always mischievous, but the Norway rat that came with the white man was worse. He began by killing and eating his aboriginal congener, and then made it more difficult than ever to keep anything eatable out of reach of his teeth. Human ingenuity, however, is superior to that of most of the lower animals, and so the `futtah' came to be - a storehouse on four posts, each of them so bevelled as to render it impossible for the cleverest rat to climb them. The same expedient is to-day in use on Stewart Island and the West Coast in fact, wherever properly constructed buildings are not available for the storage of things eatable or destructible by the rodents in question.' ... ][Futtahs are today in use on Stewart Island and the West Coast. - <i>(Feb 3, 1896,Southland Daily News</i>)

## wheelie bin
 
 <i>n.</i> a large refuse bin on wheels [I suspect wheelie-bin appears to be Oz but Can-Plan being a local trade-name is NZ. The only American words that come near I can find are trash can and garbage can but I would still suspect that it was the Americans who first put them on wheels, probably in California where they have longer drives than in New York. The Oxford Dictionary of New Words (1991) has it as "a large refuse bin on wheels; a Eurobin. The wheelie bin first appeared in the UK about 1986, but both the object and the name seem to have been used in Australia for some years before that". However, the only Oz dictionary I could find it in was Macquarie 3rd edition, no quotes, no dates but it gives as alternative names "Otto" or "Otto bin" and "Sulo" or "Sulo bin", both being trade-names a la Can-Plan. In our street where every second person is on Can-Plan, we tend now to say "The neighbour has got his can-plan out". The Yellow Pages for Wellington give a number of variants : handikarts, wheelie carts, daily karts, care carts, handcarts, wheely bin, wheelibin. **OED online: 4. Special Comb. wheelie bin orig. Austral., a large refuse bin on wheels.]

>  <b>A.S. WICKENS</b> A `whip-behind' was used by children for a swinging ride behind a cart or wagon - perhaps from the driver having to turn around and try to slash them off behind with his whip; perhaps from using the momentum of the cart to get a whip-like release; perhaps from `whipping' (that is, dashing quickly there and away again) in behind the cart for a ride. It was said, e.g.,: `I'll give you a hiding if you whip behind the baker's cart again!'

The boys who could not get hold of a strap or something would call out, `Whip behind,' and one ill-natured driver did it, too, as the coach went on. Once one of us tripped, and a heap of boys fell in the wet and mud. Dick and Bob Runciman and my little brother Dick were covered with the slurry from head to foot. We got them cleaned somehow and went on to school. (1868; Green Island, Dunedin) <i>(1981,History of Children's Play,89</i>)

>  In a <i>Sunday Star</i> special report, Mrs Russell and Mr Shallard talk about `white flight' - pakeha parents avoiding schools with high Maori and Pacific Island rolls or removing their children from such schools in favour of ones with predominantly Pakeha rolls. <i>(Jun 15, 1986,Sunday Star Times,A1</i>)

>  The Race Relations Conciliator ... has aroused much controversy since he coined the phrase `white flight' to describe parents of European - as opposed to the offensively racist and discriminatory term Pakeha - ancestry moving their children to schools where due emphasis is placed on values the majority of New Zealanders still adhere to. <i>(Oct 4, 1986,Listener (New Zealand Listener),8</i>)

## white grub
 
 <i>n.</i> (See [grass grub](../G#grass-grub))

>  There are twenty-eight native species belonging to the genus <i>Odontria,</i> but all observers agree that the principal grass grub is <i>Odontria zealandica.</i> In the larval stage this is known as `grass grub,' `white grub,' or `curl grub,' and the adult stage is known as `grass grub beetle,' `brown beetle.' or `turnip fly.' <i>(1943,NZ Journal of Science & Technology,23/306A</i>)

>  All the attention of agriculturists is now turned to the destruction of the white grub or worm that is neither more nor less than the larva of the cockchafer, that great favourite of schoolboys, but in reality one of the most mischievous insects of the temperate zone, and capable of committing as much havoc as the locust in warm climates. <i>(Feb 28, 1867,Bruce Herald,7</i>)

>  The cure also acts admirably against the white grubs that destroy the roots of grass on lawns, and has been very successfully tried upon some valuable lawns. <i>(Jan 7, 1892,Otago Witness,5</i>)

>  Probably the warm days account for the beetle of the "white grub" (Odontua striata, is it not?) being found on the wing in numbers. <i>(Aug 4, 1909,Otago Witness,85</i>)

>  The grass-grubs are the larvae of the cockchafer beeter, a Cawthron Institute bulletin points out, and are sometimes known as white grubs; these larvae are very easily recognised by the characteristic manner in which they lie doubled up in the ground. <i>(Dec 18, 1936,Evening Post,5</i>)

At various times these young people were referred to as `Teddy Boys', `Milk Bar Cowboys' and `Bodgies and Widgies'... [2] Bodgies and Widgies are members of a closely knit sex cult. This cult is centred and operates actively in Australia (and especially in Sydney).

The dress of these youngsters resembles that of the Teddy Boy and Girl, but is not so immaculate; hair is worn long and brushed back, without the characteristic Teddy Boy tuft; behaviour tends to be more boisterous and `attention provoking'. In this report such phrases as `Teddy Boy style' or `Bodgie type' are used purely as descriptive terms, to indicate certain fashions of dress which show these overseas influences. <i>(1956,Street Society in Christchurch,1</i>)

## williwaw
 
 <i>n.</i> [My thoughts were that the word sounds Scottish (willy-wombles etc) (or Scottish via Newfoundland whalers) but it doesn't turn up in any Scottish or Newfoundland Dictionary I have seen. Then whaling possibilities suggest New England but have found nothing so far. Another thought was Caribbean dictionaries (because of whaling there) but nothing turned up. One of your cits suggests Patagonian but no Patagonian dictionaries around. Meteorological dictionaries ignore it although they touch on willy-willy. Otherwise, it is just one of their unspecified "local winds". However, the attached dictionary entry seems to have a lot of sense, particularly the statement that it was common 18th Century oral nautical usage, to which can be added "preserved in some of these localities where these winds occur. dhurley 11/25/1999]

[We] entered Queen Charlotte's Sound. By this time the wind had increased to a gale from the North West, and blowing over the low ridge which divides the Sound from Port Gore, it came to us in `williwaws', that is, violent puffs, succeeded by temporary calms. You can see the Williwaw coming from a long distance; the sea is blown up in a cloud of spray; curling and whirling it sweeps down upon you, and immediately before it comes, `Let go,' shouts the skipper, and the fore and main sheets are let go, blocks rattle, masts strain, canvas flaps violently, and the weight of wind forces the vessel nearly on her beam ends. Then in half a minute it is nearly a dead calm. <i>(Nov 22, 1848,Letters,157</i>) [NOTES: (Marlborough Sounds)]

Sometimes, crossing the mouth of a bay, we caught these gusts full and were well-nigh drenched. ... In Wellington I was assured that `willy waugh' was a Scotch word, also that it was a corruption from the Maori `wirriwa', which I later found did not exist. On my return to my dictionaries in Melbourne, I found the word in the Standard as Patagonian. `Willi-wa, a violent wind from mountains in the fiords of Patagonia'. An this be true (and I can find no more about it), by what process, through what book, did the word pass from Patagonia to Queen Charlotte Sound?

When faced with a court writ on publication, the Independent ran a fable on a mythical country called [South] Wogistan in which the basic details were revealed. The term Wogistan is said by the Independent in last week's issue in a column by Chalkie (? Berryman) to have gained some currency in circles interested in the Winebox affair and may be worth picking up - I have the references. It's very PC. The first published use of the term wine box of documents may have been made by Paul East in Parliament [NZPD, p. 539]]

>  <b>HENRY BRETT</b> Then the diary goes on to duly chronicle the daily round of life aboard, one uncommon thing noted being the old sailoring custom, now a thing of the past, of `working off a dead horse.' The name is derived from the fact that in those days a sailor had a month's wages advanced to him before leaving Port. As he invariably spent it, he called the first four weeks at sea `working off a dead horse', and the end of the term was signalised by the heaving overboard, with muchceremony, of an effigy of the defunct equine. <i>(Jun 1862,Diary</i>) [NOTES: 1862 June Diary Henry Brett in 1927 Brett and Hook The Albertlanders 45]

>  <b>BUCKLEY</b> The passing of the first month [at sea in the Westminster in 1842] brought the sailors' ceremony of `burying the dead horse'. When engaged, the men received one month's pay in advance to enable them to outfit themselves. Few would have much left, so for the first month they felt themselves to be working for nothing, or `working a dead horse' which must now be buried. An equine effigy was placed on a wooden frame with four wheels, and amid loud singing was drawn around the deck three times by sailors dressed as policemen bearing staves of sailcloth filled with straw, hats of the same material and whiskers and long wigs of white yarn. The `horse' was put up for auction (the money being for liquor afterwards) and was then hoisted to the main yard-arm mounted by a sailor, during another chorus. Duly hoisted with this ceremony the `horse' was set alight by a long squib, the rope was cut, and the `poor oldman' (as the song went) fell into the sea. Thus was the dead horse buried.
